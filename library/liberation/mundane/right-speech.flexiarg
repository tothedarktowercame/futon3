! conclusion: Refrain from lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter — abstaining from the four forms of verbal misconduct.
  + context: This operates wherever speech shapes relationships and outcomes. Words are not neutral — they create connection or division, clarity or confusion, trust or suspicion.
  + IF:
    Speech can harm directly (lies, harsh words) or indirectly (division, distraction). The habit-streams of verbal conduct run deep and often operate unconsciously.
  + HOWEVER:
    Mere silence avoids the issue. And "good speech" can become performance — saying the right things to be seen as righteous. The problem is not speaking but speaking unskillfully.
  + THEN:
    Practice the four refrainings: from lying (what you know to be untrue), from divisive speech (setting people against each other), from harsh speech (words intended to wound), from idle chatter (pointless talk that wastes attention). This is the content of mundane right speech.
  + BECAUSE:
    Mundane right speech creates conditions for trust and clear communication. But one can refrain from wrong speech while still attached to being a "truthful person" or to the power that honest speech confers. This is better than wrong speech but not yet liberation.
  + MUNDANE-CONTENT:
    - Refraining from lying: not stating what is known to be false
    - Refraining from divisive speech: not speaking to create rifts
    - Refraining from harsh speech: not speaking to wound
    - Refraining from idle chatter: not wasting shared attention
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-WRONG-SPEECH:
    Wrong speech: false, divisive, harsh, nonsensical
    Mundane right speech: refraining from these four — AND awareness that the refraining itself can be grasped
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Before speaking, check: is it true? is it unifying? is it kind? is it useful?
    - Notice when speech is driven by craving for approval or fear of conflict.
    - Track the effects of speech on relationships over time.
  + RIPENS-IN:
    Better relationships, clearer communication, more trust — but still within the world of speakers and listeners, still attached to the outcomes of speech.

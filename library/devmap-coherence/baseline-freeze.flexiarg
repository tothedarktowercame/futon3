! conclusion:
  declare a baseline freeze window, capture canonical transcripts/configs/seed graphs, and wire audit hooks (`check!`, graph exports, viriya deltas) so every new change proves it still matches the frozen reference

  + context: You should implement a baseline freeze to maintain integrity by capturing key configurations and setting up audit hooks.
  + IF:
    a futon layer claims to offer a "known-good" transport or memory baseline that downstream futons rely on

  + HOWEVER:
    baselines tend to rot—golden transcripts drift, flags diverge, and the story of "what already works" fractures across READMEs

  + THEN:
    declare a baseline freeze window, capture canonical transcripts/configs/seed graphs, and wire audit hooks (`check!`, graph exports, viriya deltas) so every new change proves it still matches the frozen reference

  + BECAUSE:
    dhammavicaya is about investigating what *already* exists; without explicit freezes and audit hooks, every promise of determinism becomes oral history

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Name a freeze window, then snapshot the canonical transcripts/configs/seed graphs into a fixed location.]
    next[Add a `check!` or export hook that compares current state to the freeze baseline on each release.]

! conclusion: The work is complete and order is high, yet the moment of completion is fragile and must be sustained.
  + context: A system has reached stability and apparent success, but decay or complacency is the hidden risk.
  + IF:
    The cycles line up, outputs are correct, and the system feels "done."
  + HOWEVER:
    Completion invites drift. What is finished is also vulnerable; perfection is unstable.
  + THEN:
    Guard the edges. Maintain vigilance and small corrections to prevent unraveling.
  + BECAUSE:
    Stable order is a dynamic achievement, not a final state. Sustained coherence requires continued care.
    + evidence: Traditional: "After completion, success; yet the small fox must not wet its tail."
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Identify the fragile boundary where decay begins.
    - Introduce light maintenance cycles.
    - Pair with hexagram 64 (未濟) to keep readiness.

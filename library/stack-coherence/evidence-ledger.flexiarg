! conclusion:
  scan READMEs, git logs, and test artifacts for references to that clause; if none exist, mark the clause `unsupported` and emit a TODO to capture the evidence; otherwise record `evidence[link]`

  + context: You need to ensure that any planned work that is claimed to be done is sufficiently evidenced by concrete artifacts, or revered to a non-done state if they can't be found.
  + IF:
    a devmap clause (any futon) claims a prototype is “done” or “stable”

  + HOWEVER:
    there is no pointer to concrete evidence (README section, tag, test fixture, commit) proving it

  + THEN:
    scan READMEs, git logs, and test artifacts for references to that clause; if none exist, mark the clause `unsupported` and emit a TODO to capture the evidence; otherwise record `evidence[link]`

  + BECAUSE:
    dhammavicaya isn’t vibes—claims must cite reproducible proofs or they drift into fiction
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Anchor the codebook/transcripts task in traceable artifacts and evidence links.]

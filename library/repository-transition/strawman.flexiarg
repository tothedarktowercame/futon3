! conclusion: The current distortions in identity-space project into PCE-space as [⚡️/偏 🔥/亏]
              systemic misalignments that threaten research culture if unaddressed.

  + because: Strategy becomes reactive rather than robust.
    + illustrates: Identity distortions (e.g., uneven visibility, unclear expectations)
                   produce fragmented planning, duplicated workflows, and unclear
                   long-term repository vision.
    + therefore: Vitality and sustainability of research infrastructure degrade over time.

  + because: Responsibility is inconsistently expressed across the system.
    + illustrates: Gaps in rights metadata, embargo clarity, legacy deposits, and uneven
                   ethical governance weaken the institutional trust surface.
    + therefore: Transparency and accountability become unreliable, undermining
                 research integrity.

  + because: Connectivity becomes siloed and brittle.
    + illustrates: Metadata rigidity, disciplinary fragmentation, and disconnected
                   external deposits (GitHub, Zenodo, OSF) create gaps in discoverability
                   and interdisciplinary visibility.
    + therefore: Co-creation and cross-disciplinary engagement become harder, not easier.

  + because: Inclusivity is reduced to aspiration rather than practice.
    + illustrates: Accessibility gaps (UX, metadata, search), uneven support for PGRs and
                   minoritised groups, and inconsistent curation reduce real inclusion.
    + therefore: Equity and collegiality are compromised at the level of infrastructure.

  + because: Development pathways are constrained by system friction.
    + illustrates: Staff spend time firefighting manual processes, training burden
                   increases, and opportunities for skill growth are limited by rigid
                   workflows.
    + therefore: Career development and professional growth are hindered by the
                 repository’s operational design.

  + therefore: If left unchecked, the current projection of identity distortions into
               PCE space results in a viable-system failure: reduced sustainability,
               weakened integrity, fragmented connectivity, compromised inclusivity,
               and stunted development.

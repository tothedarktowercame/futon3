Executive Summary

talk4real reimagines doctoral training as a shared experimental learning infrastructure that continually refines itself through reflexive, collective practice. Today, most doctoral programmes operate within disciplinary or thematic silos; as a result, they engage minimally with learning beyond their boundaries and contribute little to improving practice at system level. We address this by adopting collective-intelligence frameworks that capture feedback between researchers, institutions, and communities. By embedding these feedback loops, research systems can learn from their own activity.

Concretely, talk4real applies a REPL-style cycle—read, evaluate, print, loop—to social and epistemic processes. This cycle links ethnography, computational analysis, design, and collective reflection, creating an end-to-end pathway from situated observation to system-level learning. Related precedents include realtalk@MIT, PlanetMath.org, and Peeragogy; funder-recognisable exemplars such as Zooniverse and Open Research Europe show how lightweight, open infrastructures can aggregate distributed contributions into shared knowledge.

We will run coordinated doctoral projects that instantiate the same learning architecture in distinct domains. Each doctoral scholar becomes both a researcher and an agent of collective intelligence, contributing to—and benefiting from—the shared infrastructure. The model is structured by three design principles: ethical reflexivity (participants co-author their representation); lightweight infrastructure (methods remain portable and are not locked to heavy platforms); and polyphonic governance (multiple voices are synthesised, not averaged away). In sum, talk4real turns doctoral training into a living, scalable mechanism for improving research practice across the system.

1 Rationale for the choice of research subject area

talk4real is justified as an infrastructure for collective intelligence because it converts accumulative, non-reflective research systems into learning systems that can redesign themselves. Research policies, tools, and incentives currently pile up without coherent mechanisms for reflection; institutions generate knowledge faster than they can interpret, while prevailing audits and surveys prioritise compliance over learning. The subject area is the research system itself—its policies, practices, and interactions—selected because it lacks a reliable learning architecture. We formalise a social‑psychological REPL so that reflexive learning becomes habitual from doctoral study to governance: read activity, evaluate implications, print interim synthesis, loop into redesigned practice. Simulated dialogue, participatory annotation, and iterative synthesis show the research system studying itself in real time, turning production data into shared interpretation. Doctoral projects anchor these cycles in their domains while feeding common reflection routines, so policies, tools, and incentives are shaped by evidence of how they work. In this way, talk4real converts accumulation into adaptation and enables actors across the research system to detect misalignment, test alternatives, and routinise what proves effective.

2 Relationship to existing doctoral training

talk4real augments existing doctoral training by embedding meta-learning infrastructure that enables scholars to observe, model, and re-engineer the research systems they inhabit. Most programmes teach disciplinary technique but rarely how disciplines learn from one another; this leaves scholars expert in methods yet under-equipped to connect methods across fields or to adjust the institutional conditions in which they work. talk4real addresses this gap by combining ethnography, computer science, and design so that conversation, computation, and intervention are treated as one method. In practice, scholars read activity in context, evaluate it through mixed analysis, print interim syntheses and prototypes, and loop the results back into practice. The pilot described in the Supplement instantiates this approach: it treats conversation as data and prototype as publication, keeping every scholar inside a continuous REPL cycle that ties inquiry to re-design. Because the approach is a method rather than a platform, the programme functions as portable connective tissue for other doctoral training partnerships, enabling cross-cohort self-correction without extra training burden. Doctoral projects remain anchored in their disciplinary questions, but they share a common reflexive routine that surfaces what works, where it fails, and how to adjust it. In this way, talk4real complements existing provision with a structured, lightweight way of learning from ongoing activity, so training consortia can coordinate improvement across cohorts and institutions while maintaining disciplinary depth. It sits alongside supervision and skills provision, adding a reflexive layer rather than increasing module load.

3 Added value to the field and the universities

talk4real delivers added value by supplying replicable infrastructural DNA that universities and disciplines can use to build a federated commons for adaptive governance. Ten linked doctoral projects test the same REPL learning architecture in different domains, showing how a common cycle can operate under varied conditions. Each project contributes stories, datasets, and tools to an evolving commons, enabling institutions to reflect collectively rather than in isolation. Because each uses the same cycle, contributions are comparable while retaining the specifics of their domain. The REPL routines—read practice, evaluate through analysis, print interim syntheses and prototypes, loop into redesigned practice—provide a shared method for turning activity into learning, and the accumulating materials record both practice and the reasoning that shaped it. Taken together, this constitutes the infrastructural DNA: a repeatable learning architecture and shared contributions that different disciplines can adopt without abandoning their own methods. Universities gain a practical method for adaptive governance: a way to see how policies and tools perform in use and to adjust them on evidence. The wider field gains a way to study and iteratively improve epistemic systems, with comparable materials and tested routines across projects supporting accumulation without loss of context. In short, talk4real converts dispersed doctoral activity into a federated commons for continuous learning.

4 Supervision, training, and cohort-building activities

talk4real’s supervisory and training model turns the cohort into a distributed research operating system that learns how learning itself can be designed. Supervision is collaborative and polyphonic: each researcher is supported by disciplinary mentors alongside methodological companions who help frame questions, select analyses, and review design choices.  Cohort practices make this rhythm visible and shared. Listening clinics convene scholars to present raw materials, surface signals, and compare interpretations. Signal‑boost workshops assemble adjacent projects to align measures, analyse overlaps, and co‑design interventions that can be trialled across sites. These practices ensure that conversation, computation, and intervention are treated as one method while preserving disciplinary depth. Assessment is portfolio‑based, recognising open datasets, code notebooks, and design artefacts, with open peer review across the cohort. This positions each scholar as a co‑investigator refining the infrastructure: documenting choices, sharing reusable components, and feeding results back into the common protocol. Together, the supervision pairings, shared REPL training, and cohort practices provide a concrete operating system for research learning, enabling the cohort to observe, model, and re‑engineer the systems they inhabit while building comparable, reusable outputs for future cohorts.

5 Legacy and sustainability

talk4real leaves a durable legacy by coupling open, modular infrastructure with graduates who act as agents of collective intelligence. The programme produces concrete assets—software components, data schemas, and design templates—alongside researchers trained in listening, analysis, and redesign, so capability and tools co-evolve. Each doctoral project delivers a self-contained yet interoperable prototype, designed to run locally while connecting through shared schemas and routines; sustainability therefore never depends on a single host institution. This architecture means that components can be reused, adapted, and recombined as new needs arise, while the skills to do so are embedded in the graduating cohort. Together, these elements create a system that persists beyond individual projects: graduates carry the method into new settings and adapt it to local conditions; the open components provide a common language for integration; and the documentation and templates lower the cost of establishing new instances. As new sites adopt the method, the infrastructure supports additional nodes linking universities, civic bodies, and cultural institutions, with interoperable prototypes enabling comparison without erasing context. The result is a sustainable commons: a growing network of people and components that allows institutions to observe how their practices function, test alternatives, and incorporate what works into policy and everyday operations.

6 Support

talk4real can deliver scalable, ethical, self-renewing collective research development with modest resources by drawing on lightweight assets and distributed partnerships. Its main assets—conversation, computation, and coordination—are already present within partner institutions, so core costs concentrate on doctoral stipends, cohort workshops, and minimal technical hosting. Partners such as the UK Reproducibility Network, PathOS, and the Oxford Schwartzman Centre, alongside allied studios and labs, contribute mentoring and in-kind expertise, extending support without creating large fixed costs. Open-source software and shared cloud infrastructure provide the technical backbone, while cross-university collaboration supplies the operational backbone, keeping financial overhead low and allowing methods and materials to circulate across sites. Because the programme treats dialogue, analysis, and design as reusable components, support can flex to local needs without duplicating investment; what is built in one node can be adopted by others. In turn, outputs—datasets, documentation, and prototypes—are released openly, ensuring they remain usable beyond the funding window and continue to return value as other groups adapt and improve them. This combination of modest direct spend, in-kind contributions, and open infrastructure enables the cohort to maintain ethical practice and renew its own methods over time, while creating a pathway for additional partners to join using the same lightweight commitments. In sum, limited core expenditures create assets and capability that persist, grow through reuse, and connect universities and consortia into a learning network.

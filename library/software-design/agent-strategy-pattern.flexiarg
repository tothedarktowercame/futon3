! conclusion:
  Declare small Strategy protocols (`SummarisationStrategy/summarise`, `SchedulingStrategy/next-command`, `BackoffStrategy/next-delay`) and let the agent inject or swap concrete implementations at runtime. Configuration, prompts, or telemetry choose which strategy runs, and tests exercise strategies in isolation before the agent consumes them.

  + context: You are defining how an agent selects policies or moves.

  + if:
    An agent repeatedly faces the same class of decision—summarise, schedule, pick a timeout, select a solver—yet the codebase is littered with `if`/`case` branches or feature flags that mutate behaviour in opaque ways.

  + however:
    Experimenting with new policies or tailoring behaviour per user, prototype, or futon becomes brittle when the “how” is fused to the agent core.

  + then:
    Declare small Strategy protocols (`SummarisationStrategy/summarise`, `SchedulingStrategy/next-command`, `BackoffStrategy/next-delay`) and let the agent inject or swap concrete implementations at runtime. Configuration, prompts, or telemetry choose which strategy runs, and tests exercise strategies in isolation before the agent consumes them.

  + because:
    Strategies separate intent (“summarise this log”) from method (“fast heuristic vs deep reasoning”), enabling safe experiments, per-context policy bundles, and cleaner reasoning about which solver is responsible for each outcome.

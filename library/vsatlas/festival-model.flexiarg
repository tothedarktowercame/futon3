! conclusion:
  Treat the manifold as a festival—an evolving scene where newcomers, veterans, and stewards co-create shared worlds.

  + context: You are conceptualising the 'story manifold' as a living cultural space where ongoing participation, roles, and rituals matter more than static content delivery. This does not apply to one-off exhibitions without recurring cohorts.
  + IF:
    Linear media formats keep participation limited to producers and spectators, turning the platform into a static catalog of finished works.

  + HOWEVER:
    Cultural vitality emerges from collective gatherings, ongoing creation, and interwoven practices.

  + THEN:
    Treat the manifold as a festival—an evolving scene where newcomers, veterans, and stewards co-create shared worlds.

  + BECAUSE:
    Festivals generate cultures, not commodities.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Draft one recurring festival ritual that invites newcomers into stewardship.]
    next[Name the roles for one season and define how people graduate between them.]
    next[Define a signal for when the festival model should start (e.g., repeat cohort demand) and a signal to pause.]

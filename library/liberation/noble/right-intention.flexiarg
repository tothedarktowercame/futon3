! conclusion: Not particular intentions held but the thinking faculty operating — placing, directing, and embedding of mind in one intent on the undefiled.
  + context: This operates in one developing the noble path. It is "the thinking, the placing of the mind, thought, planting, implanting, embedding of the mind, verbal process" — the directional faculty itself, not any particular direction.
  + IF:
    Even good intentions involve an intender. Renunciation can become grasping at letting go. Good will can become pride in being compassionate. Harmlessness can become aversion to harm.
  + HOWEVER:
    Abandoning all intention is not the answer — action requires direction. The problem is identification with the intender, not intention itself.
  + THEN:
    Noble right intention is the thinking faculty functioning in the context of the path — the capacity to direct attention and shape action, operating free of attachment to any particular direction. "The placing of the mind" itself, not what it's placed upon.
  + BECAUSE:
    Vitakka (thinking, placing) is wider than discursive thought. In deep practice it becomes the directional quality of mind itself — where attention goes, how engagement unfolds. Noble right intention is this directional capacity undefiled.
  + TRANSCENDENT-QUALITY:
    - Not "I intend good things" but the placing-capacity operating cleanly
    - Not attached to outcomes of intention
    - The "verbal process" (feeds into speech) functioning in wholeness
    - Intention as factor of path, supporting immersion
  + THE-RUNNING-CIRCLE:
    "Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness keep running and circling around right intention" — understanding wrong and right intention (view), working to abandon wrong and cultivate right (effort), doing so mindfully.
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-MUNDANE:
    Mundane: "I cultivate renunciation, good will, harmlessness" (still an I cultivating)
    Noble: The thinking faculty placing and directing, intent on the undefiled
  + WORN-AWAY:
    "For one of right intention, wrong intention is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong intention are worn away."

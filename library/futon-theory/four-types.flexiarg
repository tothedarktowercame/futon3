! conclusion:
  Four interrelated types describe how structure becomes behavior becomes
  interface becomes portable pattern: genotype (internal), phenotype (observable),
  exotype (connectable), xenotype (transplantable).

  + context: In heterogeneous programming and evolutionary systems, these four
    types represent different facets of the same transformable system. Each
    provides a distinct lens for understanding how capability evolves.

  + GENOTYPE (基因型):
    The replicable, persistable, versionable internal representation.
    - Rule sets, programs, pattern DAGs, DSL fragments
    - Parameter priors, replayable generators
    - What can be stored and version-controlled
    - The "recipe" that generates behavior

  + PHENOTYPE (表型):
    Observable behavior and performance in environment.
    - Actual outputs, interaction behavior
    - Test metrics, performance curves
    - What can be measured and compared
    - The "result" of executing the genotype

  + EXOTYPE (外顯子型):
    Externally visible type/interface shape.
    - Interface contracts, data formats, APIs
    - Signal/control surfaces, I/O types, event protocols
    - Not behavior itself, but the shape through which behavior connects
    - What makes components composable

  + XENOTYPE (異種型):
    Cross-domain portable control/generation structure.
    - Meta-CA rules, variational search structures
    - Categorical wiring, portable generator+selector combinations
    - A transplantable higher-order embryo
    - Can be projected onto different genotype forms

  + RELATIONSHIPS:
    xenotype: Cross-domain "generate—select" skeleton
        ↓ projects to
    genotype: Concrete instantiation (language/DSL/rule table)
        ↓ executes as
    phenotype: Observable performance (measurable)
        ↔ connects via
    exotype: Interface shape (wireable)

  + APPLICATION-TO-FUTON:
    - genotype: Pattern definitions, DSL specs, rule configurations
    - phenotype: System behavior, test results, API responses
    - exotype: Layer interfaces (L0↔L1, L1↔L2), event protocol shapes
    - xenotype: Baldwin cycle itself, applicable at any interface

  + BECAUSE:
    Conflating these types leads to confusion: optimizing behavior (phenotype)
    without capturing it (genotype), or defining interfaces (exotype) that
    don't compose across domains (missing xenotype). Separating them enables
    systematic evolution with auditability.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Map existing futon layer interfaces to exotype specifications]
    next[Identify xenotype structures that can be reused across layers]

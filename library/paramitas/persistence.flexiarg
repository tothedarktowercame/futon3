! conclusion: Design long-term work around legible forms of life, not only output or recognition.
  + context: You are sustaining a long-arc practice that blends research, tooling, reflection, and ethical orientation without assuming value must be proven through money or credentials.
  + IF:
    Persistence is framed only in terms of continuous output, remuneration, or institutional approval.
  + HOWEVER:
    Many viable forms of persistence are recognized through stable practices, roles, and visible patterns of conduct.
  + THEN:
    Design persistence around legible forms of life: practices that remain coherent and intentional over time, regardless of whether they are rewarded, certified, or monetized.
  + BECAUSE:
    Long-term work survives only when it is socially and internally intelligible as a way of living.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Identify which aspects of your practice already function as recognizable roles.
    - Test external wrappers only insofar as they make the practice more visible without distorting it.

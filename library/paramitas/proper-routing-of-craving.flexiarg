! conclusion: Treat craving as informational signal and route it to the domain that can legitimately respond.
  + context: You are engaged in demanding creative, technical, or relational work and notice recurring frustration or longing across multiple domains.
  + IF:
    You experience craving and find yourself implicitly asking nearby people or activities to satisfy it.
  + HOWEVER:
    Cravings attach to whatever is salient rather than to what can actually produce the desired quality, leading to misattribution and persistent suffering.
  + THEN:
    Reframe craving as an informational signal about conditions and route it to the domain that can legitimately respond (technical frustration to model contracts, affective confusion to slow inquiry, relational warmth to appreciation without obligation, aesthetic desire to cultivating the right conditions).
  + BECAUSE:
    Craving is a pointer toward missing conditions; acting on it without checking jurisdiction produces category errors.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Notice where craving is being misrouted and identify the condition it points toward.
    - Observe whether you are willing to cultivate the practices that would make that condition likely.

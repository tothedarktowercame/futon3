! conclusion:
  The 25 math-informal patterns are not just annotations — they are operational
  agent strategies. Each pattern tells an agent what to do next when reasoning
  about a mathematical problem.

  + context: You are designing agents that use the math-informal pattern library
    as a repertoire of reasoning moves, following Pólya's tradition of heuristic
    problem solving.
  + IF:
      The 25 math-informal patterns each have a conclusion (what the pattern achieves),
      an IF/HOWEVER/THEN/BECAUSE structure (when and how to apply it), keywords
      (for recognition in text), and next-steps (what follows from applying it).

  + HOWEVER:
      Patterns as written describe human reasoning strategies. An LLM agent may apply
      them differently: it cannot truly "try a simpler case" the way a human does, but
      it can decompose a question and generate a simpler sub-question. The mapping from
      human heuristic to agent action is not always one-to-one.

  + THEN:
      For each of the 25 patterns, define an agent-operational interpretation: what
      the Asker does with this pattern (generate a question), what the Answerer does
      (construct an answer step), what the Critic does (check a condition). Include
      the pattern's flexiarg keywords in the agent's prompt so it can name the pattern
      it is using. Track which patterns the agents actually use via PSR/PUR records.

  + BECAUSE:
      The Corneli (2014) thesis (§10.6) calls for agents that can "apply standard and
      social problem solving heuristics." The thesis Appendix B demonstrates that proofs
      can be coded as sequences of pattern applications. The 25 flexiarg patterns are
      the operational vocabulary for this coding. If agents can name and apply them,
      the thesis's computational vision is realized.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Write agent-operational interpretation for at least 8 high-use patterns (the ones in M-f6-agents Table).]
    next[Include pattern keywords in Agent B prompt template for M-f6-eval.]
    next[After M-f6-agents Phase 1: measure which patterns agents cite most and whether citations are accurate.]

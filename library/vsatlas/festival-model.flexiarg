! conclusion:
  Treat the manifold as a festival—an evolving scene where newcomers, veterans, and stewards co-create shared worlds.

  + context: You are conceptualising the 'story manifold' as a living cultural space where ongoing participation, roles, and rituals matter more than static content delivery.
  + IF:
    Linear media formats keep participation limited to producers and spectators, turning the platform into a static catalog of finished works.

  + HOWEVER:
    Cultural vitality emerges from collective gatherings, ongoing creation, and interwoven practices.

  + THEN:
    Treat the manifold as a festival—an evolving scene where newcomers, veterans, and stewards co-create shared worlds.

  + BECAUSE:
    Festivals generate cultures, not commodities.

! conclusion:
  for every recorded episode, check that pivot streams, graph adapters, and presence bridges emit data usable by the FUTON3 proof engine and FUTON7 civic dashboards

  + context: Ensure the data emitted from your processes is usable by the FUTON3 proof engine to allow for effective collaboration.
  + IF:
    FUTON2 exposes narratable AIF loops whose agents export state into FUTON1 and FUTON3

  + HOWEVER:
    ants risk becoming isolated war-game toys unless their exports feed graph memory, presence buses, and viriya metrics

  + THEN:
    for every recorded episode, check that pivot streams, graph adapters, and presence bridges emit data usable by the FUTON3 proof engine and FUTON7 civic dashboards

  + BECAUSE:
    viriya means kinetic collaboration—without these hooks, energy cannot circulate through the stack

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add a validation step that checks each episode's exports against the proof engine and civic dashboard schemas.]
    next[Publish a dashboard panel showing missing or malformed exports by agent and episode.]

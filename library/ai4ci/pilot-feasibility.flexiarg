! conclusion:
  A six-month evaluation is feasible because the project is deliberately
  scoped to test whether mid-level reasoning cues can be extracted and
  validated, not to build new AI systems or long-term infrastructure.

  + context: You are defending the six-month timeline by tying scope to specific, trackable activities.
  + IF:
    Repository-transition invariants and stack-blocker detection already
    describe what infrastructure exists and how to keep scope aligned with
    available capacity.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without explicit scope fences, a project framed around “AI and
    explanation” can drift into trying to develop storage, user interfaces,
    or new models, making the schedule unrealistic.

  + THEN:
    Freeze scope to: proof selection, dual-layer annotation (AI proposals
    plus human review), seminar-based evaluation, and reporting; track each
    clause with explicit next-steps so diverging work is visible as scope
    creep.

  + BECAUSE:
    Dhammavicaya (keen investigation) in this context demands evidence that
    the pilot answers a clear methodological question—whether a recoverable
    reasoning layer exists—rather than attempting production-grade systems.

  + STATUS:
    status[ready]
    evidence[library/repository-transition/invariants.flexiarg:1]
    evidence[library/stack-coherence/stack-blocker-detection.flexiarg:1]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Map the proof sample, annotation sprints, and seminars onto a simple timeline and publish it in the devmap.]
    next[Record blockers and clears weekly so stack-coherence patterns can demonstrate that the pilot stayed within its declared scope.]

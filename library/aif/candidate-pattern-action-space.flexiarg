! conclusion: Treat action selection as choosing from a bounded candidate set of pattern IDs.
  + context: Action selection in fulab often means selecting (and committing to) a pattern to apply next.
  + IF:
    You want pattern choice to be legible and comparable, and you want to avoid collapse into one habitual pattern.
  + HOWEVER:
    If the action space is any pattern at any time, evaluation becomes unstructured and selection becomes arbitrary or dominated by recency.
  + THEN:
    Define (a) as a constructed candidate set of pattern IDs produced by retrieval plus gating rules, with bounded size and explicit reasons for inclusion and exclusion.
  + BECAUSE:
    Constraining the action space makes downstream scoring meaningful rather than performative.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Track coverage stats: how often each pattern enters the candidate set versus how often it is chosen.
    - Use those stats to distinguish retrieval bias from policy bias.

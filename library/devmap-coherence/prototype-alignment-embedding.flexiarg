! conclusion:
  maintain a canonical `patterns-index` (Tokipona section, truth-table Hanzi, rationale) and a compression log (`resources/sigils/compressions.edn`); any new pattern addition or mapping change must append to the log and update the index before regenerating CSVs

  + context: Maintain an up-to-date patterns-index and compression log to ensure reproducible and reliable semantic embeddings.
  + IF:
    FUTON3 relies on a “fake embedding” (sigil distances + Tokipona/Hanzi mappings) to suggest patterns

  + HOWEVER:
    without an index + rationale log, embeddings drift from actual semantics and become irreproducible

  + THEN:
    maintain a canonical `patterns-index` (Tokipona section, truth-table Hanzi, rationale) and a compression log (`resources/sigils/compressions.edn`); any new pattern addition or mapping change must append to the log and update the index before regenerating CSVs

  + BECAUSE:
    embedding discipline lets pattern-capable agents trust similarity queries and keeps the system replicable

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Update `patterns-index` and `resources/sigils/compressions.edn` before regenerating any embedding CSVs.]
    next[Record every mapping change in the compression log with rationale.]

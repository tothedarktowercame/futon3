! conclusion:
  Transform your problem until it matches the hypothesis of a known theorem, then invoke it.

  + context: You want to prove a result and suspect it follows from something already established.
  + IF:
      The conclusion you need resembles the conclusion of a known theorem, but the hypotheses
      do not quite match your setup.

  + HOWEVER:
      Forcing a reduction to the wrong theorem produces fragile, unenlightening proofs. The
      reduction step must be natural, not a contortion.

  + THEN:
      Identify the candidate theorem. Compare its hypotheses to your situation. Bridge the gap:
      verify missing hypotheses, apply a change of variables, restrict to a subcase, or
      reformulate to match. Then invoke the theorem.

  + BECAUSE:
      Mathematics is cumulative. The power of a proof is proportional to the depth of the results
      it can invoke. "By Theorem X" is the most efficient move in mathematics when X genuinely
      applies.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify which known result has the conclusion you need.]
    next[Compare hypotheses: what is missing or different?]
    next[Bridge the gap or choose a different target theorem.]

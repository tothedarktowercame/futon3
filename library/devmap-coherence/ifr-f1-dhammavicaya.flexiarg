@title IFR — FUTON1 Graph Memory Seed (dhammavicaya)
@sigils [🗂️/工 👀/己]
@factor Keen investigation (dhammavicaya)

! conclusion:
  run the FUTON3 `check!` DSL against Pattern Canon entries that certify the MUSN transport baseline, verifying that each CLI/ingest transcript has a reproducible twin in futon1 graphs

  + context: You are expected to validate that all CLI transcripts have a match in futon1 graphs to ensure consistent baseline transport.
  + IF:
    the system maintains a deterministic graph-memory snapshot of the personal stack (CLI transcripts, NLP tags, XTDB mirrors)

  + HOWEVER:
    focus headers, ingest scripts, and CLI demos drift unless transport invariants are checked and documented

  + THEN:
    run the FUTON3 `check!` DSL against Pattern Canon entries that certify the MUSN transport baseline, verifying that each CLI/ingest transcript has a reproducible twin in futon1 graphs

  + BECAUSE:
    without codified dhammavicaya, higher futons cannot inspect “the system model of me” with confidence

! conclusion:
  What NER covers is formal scaffolding; what NER leaves behind is where
  informal reasoning patterns live. The two are complementary masks over
  the same text, not competing annotations.

  + context: You are annotating mathematical text with both named entities (terms,
    definitions, symbols) and informal reasoning patterns (heuristics, strategies).
  + IF:
      NER term spotting identifies formal mathematical objects (named theorems,
      defined terms, variable bindings) and pattern tagging identifies informal
      reasoning moves (argue-by-contradiction, try-a-simpler-case, etc.).

  + HOWEVER:
      It is tempting to treat these as independent annotation layers applied to
      different documents or different classes of text. In fact, both systems fire
      on the same documents: high-term entities also have more patterns, not fewer.
      The duality is spatial within text, not across documents.

  + THEN:
      Run both NER and pattern tagging on every document. Treat the NER-covered
      tokens as "formal figure" and the remaining tokens as "informal ground."
      Measure negative-space percentage (typically 87-99% of tokens). Use the
      ratio as a document-level feature: low negative-space means dense formal
      content; high negative-space means discursive reasoning.

  + BECAUSE:
      The Corneli (2014) thesis codes proofs as alternating formal steps (definition
      expansion, deduction) and informal moves (conjecture, heuristic selection).
      NER captures the former; the 25 math-informal patterns capture the latter.
      Together they give an agent structured understanding that flat text cannot.

    next[Use negative-space ratio as a feature in M-f6-eval stratified sampling.]
    next[Feed both layers to Agent B in M-f6-eval to test whether dual annotation outperforms either alone.]

! conclusion: talk4real can deliver scalable, ethical, self-renewing collective research development with modest resources by leveraging lightweight assets and distributed partnerships. [👫/女 🌞/工]
  + because: Its main assets are conversation, computation, and coordination already present in partner institutions, so core costs focus on stipends, workshops, and hosting.
  + because: Partners such as the UK Reproducibility Network, PathOS, and the Oxford Schwartzman Centre plus allied studios and labs contribute mentoring and in-kind expertise.
  + because: Open-source software, shared cloud infrastructure, and cross-university collaboration keep financial overhead minimal while maximising reach.
  + therefore: Outputs—data, documentation, prototypes—remain freely available, ensuring continuing value beyond the funding window.

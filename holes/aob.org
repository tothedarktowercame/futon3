* Indicators 🍍 (System-wide Cybernetics)
🗝️ Philosophical rationale: regular embodied and creative practice maintains system vitality and provides early signals of imbalance.
- Attend tai chi class 1–2× per week and learn as much of “Tai Chi 28” as possible.
- Track exercise, energy, and sleep patterns using the FUTON0 Clock.
- Create 170 additional short recordings for *The Penmaster’s Apprentice Saga* between now and the end of August. (That works out to approximately one every other day.)
- Log and tag daily work sessions in FUTON1 
- During monthly and quarterly reviews, assess whether there are patterns and whether they support (or hinder) other ambitions.

* 🥨 Salients (System-wide Epistemology)
🗝️ Philosophical rationale: I am developing a "programme" for myself and should use programming theory to check it
- Maintain weekly rhythm of review and reflection (AOB check-in, Ambitions sync).
- Keep Org-based data as single source of truth for planning and export.
- Track deliverables transparently across institutional and personal projects.
- Preserve equilibrium across five spheres (Institutional, Consulting, Technical, Reflective, Infrastructure).
- Regularly review WIP balance to avoid overload (>3 active focus areas).

* 🍐 Obligations (System-wide Ontology)
🗝️ Philosophical rationale: I need to exist within the economy and the limits of human health
- Perform well in my job
- Get a new job before the end of August 2026
- Get enough exercise
- Get enough sleep

* Ambition 0 🚀 Build and maintain a meta-managed infrastructure for coherent living and working
🗝️ Philosophical rationale: meta-reflection enables coherence; infrastructure must serve awareness, not bureaucracy.

** Salients 🥨
- Maintain clean data pipeline between Org, FUTON, and external storage.
- Keep dashboard views simple, accurate, and current.
- Review cross-project meta-workflow monthly to ensure it reflects lived priorities.

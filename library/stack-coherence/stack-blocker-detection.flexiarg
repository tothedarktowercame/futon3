! conclusion:
  scan devmaps for declared dependencies, inspect referenced dirs/tests/commits, and emit a blocker report for each clause: `blocked-by[...]`, `evidence[...]`, `status[ready/not-ready]`

  + context: You want to be able to track unmet dependencies between projects, prototypes and components by inspecting downstream artifacts, so lack of progress is clearly attributed to specific blockers.
  + IF:
    a futon layer or prototype declares prerequisites (“requires futon3 prototype 8”, “needs graph-memory adapter”), yet the downstream directory/README is still empty

  + HOWEVER:
    without explicit blocker reports, emptiness reads as “nobody cares” instead of “waiting on X/Y”

  + THEN:
    scan devmaps for declared dependencies, inspect referenced dirs/tests/commits, and emit a blocker report for each clause: `blocked-by[...]`, `evidence[...]`, `status[ready/not-ready]`

  + BECAUSE:
    dhammavicaya means naming what already exists—and what is still blocking it—so we don’t conflate “not started” with “stalled”

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Scan devmaps for declared prerequisites and emit blocker reports with evidence links.]
    next[Review blockers weekly and mark readiness once dependencies land.]

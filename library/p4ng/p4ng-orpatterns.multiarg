! instantiated-by: License Laddering
  + context: In Open Research projects, licensing choices often stall progress and collaboration.
  + if: You want maximal remixability while preserving dignity and attribution.
  + however: Legal anxiety and moral caution create paralysis.
  + then: Begin from a permissive default and establish a clear sequence of license “steps” that can be tightened later as needed.
  + because: Progressive licensing reduces fear-driven restriction and allows flexibility as the project matures.

@title Pattern Differentiation Alarms
@sigils [👂/习]
@factor Keen investigation (dhammavicaya)

! conclusion:
  treat duplicated sigils as alarms: inspect the overlapping clauses, decide whether to merge them, split out a sharper pattern, or introduce a new check canon; document the decision and rerun the embedding cycle

  + context: You are resolving sigil collisions so similarity checks stay meaningful.
  + IF:
    the same Tokipona/hanzi sigil pair keeps appearing across multiple devmaps or clauses

  + HOWEVER:
    repetition usually means we lack a specific pattern or haven’t articulated the distinctive obligation

  + THEN:
    treat duplicated sigils as alarms: inspect the overlapping clauses, decide whether to merge them, split out a sharper pattern, or introduce a new check canon; document the decision and rerun the embedding cycle

  + BECAUSE:
    sigils are coordinates in the fake embedding—when they collapse, it signals our pattern library is too coarse for dhammavicaya to stay honest

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Log the next collision and document the merge or split decision.]

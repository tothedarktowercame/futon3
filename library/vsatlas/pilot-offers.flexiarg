! conclusion:
  Translate successful pilots into a few clearly named offerings that
  organisations can adopt and fund.

  + context: You are focused on converting pilot learnings into clearly named programmes, so partners can recognise what is being offered and why it matters.
  + IF:
    Pilots show that linked stories help cohorts see shared situations.

  + HOWEVER:
    Leaving results as “internal improvements” obscures what partners are buying.

  + THEN:
    Package the practice into offers (e.g., connected community story lab, linked
    stories module) with activities + outcomes.

  + BECAUSE:
    Partners decide based on named programmes, not raw features.

! conclusion:
  Add an interpretive “askew” layer where contributors propose arcs, passages, and conceptual bridges without modifying originals.

  + context: You are designing a narrative system where contributors can explore interpretations and relationships without altering canonical stories, preserving authorial integrity while enabling sense-making. This does not apply when the canonical layer can be edited by mutual consent.
  + IF:
    Canonical stories must be preserved yet contributors need room to explore relations.

  + HOWEVER:
    Forcing links into the canonical layer violates narrative sovereignty and breeds incoherence.

  + THEN:
    Add an interpretive “askew” layer where contributors propose arcs, passages, and conceptual bridges without modifying originals.

  + BECAUSE:
    Interpretive overlays let relational meaning emerge while protecting authorial integrity.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define a lightweight "askew" proposal schema and review workflow.]
    next[Prototype one askew bridge on an existing story pair.]
    next[Define apply/avoid signals (e.g., "canon locked" vs "canon editable").]
    next[Record one case where askew prevented a canonical conflict and one where it added noise.]
    next[Consolidate with vsatlas/non-destructive-relational-layers and retire this pattern once merged.]

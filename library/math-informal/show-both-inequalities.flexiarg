! conclusion:
  To prove equality, prove inequality in both directions.

  + context: You want to show A = B (where A, B are numbers, sets, or objects in an ordered structure)
    and no direct computation yields both sides at once.
  + IF:
      Direct computation of A or B is infeasible, but you can bound A from above by B and
      from below by B (or equivalently, show A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A).

  + HOWEVER:
      The two directions may require completely different techniques. One direction is often
      trivial while the other requires the bulk of the work. Identifying which is which
      saves effort.

  + THEN:
      Prove A <= B and B <= A separately (or A is a subset of B and B is a subset of A).
      Combine to conclude A = B. For the squeeze/sandwich variant: bound A from above and
      below by quantities that both converge to the same limit.

  + BECAUSE:
      This is one of the most common proof structures in analysis (sandwich theorem, integral
      bounds), set theory (Cantor-Bernstein), and algebra (showing ideals or subgroups are
      equal). It reduces equality to two often-simpler one-directional claims.

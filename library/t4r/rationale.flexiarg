! conclusion: talk4real is justified as an infrastructure for collective intelligence because it converts accumulative, non-reflective research systems into learning systems that can redesign themselves. [🌐/悟 🏠/策]
  + context: You are establishing the foundational justification for the programme.
  + IF:
    The research system lacks built-in reflexive learning loops.
  + HOWEVER:
    Existing audits emphasise compliance rather than adaptation.
  + THEN:
    Introduce a REPL-style infrastructure that turns research into a learning system.
  + BECAUSE:
    Research policies, tools, and incentives currently pile up without coherent mechanisms for reflection.
    Institutions generate knowledge faster than they can interpret, while prevailing audits and surveys prioritise compliance over learning.
    The Supplement’s simulated dialogue, participatory annotation, and iterative synthesis show the research system studying itself in real time.
    Formalising a social-psychological REPL makes reflexive learning habitual from doctoral study to institutional governance.
  + NEXT-STEPS:

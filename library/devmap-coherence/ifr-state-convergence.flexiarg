! conclusion:
  compare each IFR against README truths, prototypes, and evidence. If the
  gaps are cosmetic, close the clause; if they are structural, flag blockers so
  stack triage can route the work or consciously pause it.

  + context: You must compare IFRs with existing evidence to identify structural gaps and prevent stalled progress.
  + IF:
    every futon carries an Ideal Final Result plus a current-state description.

  + HOWEVER:
    mature layers can sound “done” even when structural gaps remain, while
    truly complete layers linger as open obligations.

  + THEN:
    compare each IFR against README truths, prototypes, and evidence. If the
    gaps are cosmetic, close the clause; if they are structural, flag blockers so
    stack triage can route the work or consciously pause it.

  + BECAUSE:
    dhammavicaya requires evidence for keeping a layer active.

  + STATUS:

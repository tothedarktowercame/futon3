! conclusion:
  When stuck, go back to the definition and write out exactly what it says.

  + context: You need to prove or use a property of an object, and the path forward is not clear.
  + IF:
      The statement involves a defined concept (compact, continuous, exact, measurable, adjoint)
      and you are treating it as a black box instead of engaging with its content.

  + HOWEVER:
      Definitions can unfold into multiple equivalent characterisations, and not all unfoldings
      are equally useful. Choosing the wrong characterisation can make the problem harder.

  + THEN:
      Write out the definition of every technical term in the statement. Replace defined terms
      with their meanings. The proof obligation often becomes clear once the definitions are
      fully expanded. If multiple equivalent definitions exist, try each one.

  + BECAUSE:
      Most proofs at the textbook level consist of nothing more than carefully unfolding
      definitions. "I don't see how to start" almost always means "I haven't written out
      what the words mean."

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify which terms in the statement are defined concepts.]
    next[Write out each definition fully.]
    next[See which unfolding makes the proof obligation match your tools.]

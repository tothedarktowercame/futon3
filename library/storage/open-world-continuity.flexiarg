! conclusion:
  allow background knowledge ingest to accumulate in the same persistent store outside interactive sessions

  + context: futon1’s devmap positions open-world ingest as a core way to build shared knowledge.
  + IF:
    knowledge needs to accumulate beyond interactive sessions

  + HOWEVER:
    separate stores or session-only ingestion fragment the graph

  + THEN:
    ingest open-world data into the same persistent store with the same invariants

  + BECAUSE:
    background knowledge must remain queryable and coherent with session data

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L44]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L100]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define open-world ingest contracts and validation rules for futon1a.]
    next[Add tests verifying open-world data survives restart and is queryable.]

# Futon Theory Pattern Library

Design patterns that specify futon theory with sufficient generality to drive
development of the entire FUTON stack.

## Design Principle: Abstract Theory, Concrete Domains

These patterns are **abstract** - they define constraints and structures without
implementation-specific language. Domain-specific instantiations live elsewhere:

- `library/storage/` - Storage layer patterns (XTDB, Datascript specifics)
- `library/network/` - Network layer patterns (future)
- `library/simulation/` - Simulation patterns (future)

**Durability is enforced via invariants (I0), not axioms.** The axioms (A1-A5)
are operational (how work proceeds); invariants (I0-I4) are structural (what
must hold). This separation keeps theory portable across domains.

## Core Concepts

### The Proof Path

The fundamental unit of work in futon theory. Every change follows an auditable
path from intent to durable proof.

```
Intent → CLOCK_IN → OBSERVE → PROPOSE_CLAIM → APPLY_CHANGE
       → VERIFY → INVARIANT_CHECK → PROOF_COMMIT → CLOCK_OUT
```

See: [proof-path.flexiarg](proof-path.flexiarg)

### Axioms (A1-A5)

| Axiom | Statement | Pattern |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| A1 | Auditability first | proof-path, event-protocol |
| A2 | Changes attributable | agent-contract |
| A3 | Evidence-driven progression | symbolic-geodesic |
| A4 | Degradation detectable | counter-ratchet, error-hierarchy |
| A5 | Minimum viable events | minimum-viable-events |

### Invariants (I0-I4)

| Layer | Invariant | Statement | Pattern |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Persistence | What you save is what you get back | durability-first |
| 1 | Identity | One entity per identity, no ambiguity | single-source-of-truth |
| 2 | Integrity | Startup succeeds completely or fails loudly | all-or-nothing |
| 3 | Hierarchy | Errors surface at the layer that caused them | error-hierarchy |
| 4 | Debugging | Any bug diagnosable in under 10 minutes | rapid-debugging |

### Supporting Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| event-protocol | Canonical event sequence for proof paths |
| symbolic-geodesic | Shortest defensible path from intent to verified claim |
| retrospective-stability | Proof paths survive future refinement without rewriting |
| agent-contract | Requirements for agents operating in the stack |
| counter-ratchet | Key counts must not drop unexpectedly |
| stop-the-line | Block changes when invariants fail |
| curry-howard-operational | Specs mediate future state into present |

## Evolutionary Patterns (from futon5)

How the stack evolves while maintaining auditability.

### Four Types (型)

| Type | Description | In Futon |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Genotype (基因型) | Replicable internal representation | Rules, patterns, DSL, priors |
| Phenotype (表型) | Observable behavior in environment | Outputs, test metrics, API responses |
| Exotype (外顯子型) | Interface shape (connectable) | Layer contracts, event protocols |
| Xenotype (異種型) | Portable control structure | Baldwin cycle, reusable at any interface |

See: [four-types.flexiarg](four-types.flexiarg)

### Baldwin Cycle

```
EXPLORE (within exotype constraints)
    ↓ successful adaptation
ASSIMILATE (fix into genotype, with evidence)
    ↓ proven success
CANALIZE (remove freedom, make success cheap)
```

See: [baldwin-cycle.flexiarg](baldwin-cycle.flexiarg)

### Evolutionary Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| four-types | Genotype/phenotype/exotype/xenotype framework |
| baldwin-cycle | Explore → assimilate → canalize loop |
| interface-loop | Baldwin cycle at each layer boundary |
| local-gain-persistence | Gains must persist or be explicitly deleted |
| xenotype-portability | Same adaptation skeleton, many instantiations |

### Key Invariant

**LocalGainMustEitherPersistOrBeDeleted**: Any functional gain at an interface
must either be assimilated to genotype (replayable) or explicitly removed.
No ghost capabilities.

See: [local-gain-persistence.flexiarg](local-gain-persistence.flexiarg)

### Theory as Exotype (Meta-Level)

The four-types framework applies recursively:

```
Level 0 (Meta):     futon-theory ─────────────── exotype
                         ↓ constrains
Level 1 (Domain):   storage-patterns ─────────── genotype
                         ↓ instantiates
Level 2 (Code):     futon1a ─────────────────── phenotype
```

The same derivation xenotype applies to all domains:

| Domain | Derived Patterns | Implementation |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Storage | write-through-with-sync, unique-constraint | futon1a |
| Network | message-with-receipt, session-bracketing | futon3 |
| Simulation | explore-then-fix, layer-adaptation | futon5 |
| Coordination | distributed-proof-path | futon4 |

See: [theory-as-exotype.flexiarg](theory-as-exotype.flexiarg)

## Layered Architecture

```
Layer 4: Model Validation (400 Bad Request)
    ↑ depends on
Layer 3: Authorization (403 Forbidden)
    ↑ depends on
Layer 2: Integrity (500 Internal Server Error)
    ↑ depends on
Layer 1: Identity (409 Conflict)
    ↑ depends on
Layer 0: Durability (503 Service Unavailable)
    ↑ depends on nothing
```

Each layer is a gate. If Layer N fails, Layers N+1 and above never run.
Errors surface at the lowest failing layer.

## Usage

These patterns drive:
- **futon1a**: Ground-up rebuild with unbreakable core invariants
- **futon3 checks**: Verification DSL for proof paths
- **Lab sessions**: Agent behavior conforming to event protocol
- **Stack coherence**: Cross-repo invariant enforcement

## Example: futon1a Module Mapping

| Module | Pattern(s) |
|--------|------------|
| `core/xtdb.clj` | durability-first |
| `core/identity.clj` | single-source-of-truth |
| `core/entity.clj` | all-or-nothing |
| `core/rehydrate.clj` | all-or-nothing |
| `api/errors.clj` | error-hierarchy |
| `diag/health.clj` | rapid-debugging |

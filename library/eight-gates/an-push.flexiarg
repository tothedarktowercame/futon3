! conclusion: Push with your whole structure, not just your extremities; the thrust comes from integrated alignment.
  + context: An agent needs to apply forward force to move a situation, make progress, or assert direction.
  + IF:
    The moment calls for decisive forward motion—not redirection, not yielding, but actual push.
  + HOWEVER:
    Pushing from the arms alone has no power. Force that doesn't come from the whole structure dissipates or unbalances the pusher. The push can be horizontal, or angled up or down—but it must be structural.
  + THEN:
    Align your entire structure behind the push. Àn uses both hands but the thrust originates from the body's integrated frame—feet rooted, core engaged, intent unified. The push is not aggression; it's aligned forward motion where every part contributes.
  + BECAUSE:
    Exploit policy (goal-focused forward motion) only works when the whole preference model is aligned—scope verified, risks acknowledged, desired futures clear. Pushing without alignment is flailing. Structural push transforms situations.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Before pushing forward, verify structural alignment (scope + risks + desired).
    - Engage the whole system, not just surface actions.
    - Direction can vary (up, down, forward) but integration cannot.

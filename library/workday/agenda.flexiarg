@title Single-Focus Amidst Agenda Saturation

! conclusion: Single-Focus Amidst Agenda Saturation
  + context: The week agenda contains many TODO, NEXT, WAIT, and SHIP items across ORPM and AOB, but only one item is explicitly marked FOCUS.
  + IF:
    There is exactly one FOCUS item while multiple other tasks remain scheduled, recurring, or deadline-bearing.
  + HOWEVER:
    Several non-FOCUS items still demand attention due to deadlines, dependencies, or institutional expectations.
  + THEN:
    Treat the FOCUS item as the sole candidate for discretionary depth, and constrain all other items to execution at their minimal viable level unless they directly unblock or materially enrich the FOCUS.
  + BECAUSE:
    A single declared focus only functions as such if it is protected from dilution by equally attention-hungry tasks.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Check whether any non-FOCUS items causally unblock or substantially reshape the FOCUS; if so, either promote them or explicitly time-box them to prevent silent priority creep.]

@title Close Then Reframe Focus
@sigils [🚴/专 👋/一]

! conclusion: Close Then Reframe Focus
  + context: The current agenda has one explicit FOCUS item alongside many scheduled tasks that have accumulated partial progress or overrun status.
  + IF:
    A FOCUS item is sufficiently bounded that it can be brought to a defensible stopping point.
  + HOWEVER:
    Multiple overrun items compete as plausible successors and risk pulling attention prematurely.
  + THEN:
    Complete the current FOCUS to a clear "finished enough" artifact, then deliberately select the next FOCUS from the overrun set based on leverage rather than urgency.
  + BECAUSE:
    Focus only compounds value when it reaches closure, producing a reference point that informs the next prioritization rather than fragmenting effort.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define what counts as "done enough" for the current FOCUS, list overrun items with a one-line statement of leverage, and choose the next FOCUS explicitly rather than by drift.]

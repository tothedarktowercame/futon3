! conclusion:
  Define a simple offer ladder (intro workshop → multi-session pilot → annual programme) where each rung has a clear scope, price band, and expected outcome.

  + context: You are translating 'story manifold' capabilities into a small set of concrete (purchasable) offerings that institutions can understand, budget for, and adopt.
  + IF:
    A story platform with rich theory but no articulated “offers” risks being seen as a research toy rather than a service.

  + HOWEVER:
    Communities, NGOs, and universities buy concrete packages—workshops, courses, facilitation, reporting—rather than abstract infrastructures.

  + THEN:
    Define a simple offer ladder (intro workshop → multi-session pilot → annual programme) where each rung has a clear scope, price band, and expected outcome.

  + BECAUSE:
    A visible ladder of offers turns VSATLAS from an idea into a portfolio of bookable engagements that can recover costs and demonstrate real-world demand.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Draft the three-rung ladder with scope, price band, and outcomes.]
    next[Test the ladder with one partner and refine based on feedback.]

! conclusion:
  When a single argument cannot handle all situations, partition into cases and handle each one.

  + context: You are trying to prove a statement that behaves differently depending on some
    condition or parameter value.
  + IF:
      The objects or hypotheses fall into a finite number of qualitatively different types,
      and the proof technique that works for one type fails for another.

  + HOWEVER:
      Too many cases make a proof unreadable and suggest you are missing a unifying idea.
      If you find yourself with more than 3-4 cases, consider whether a different approach
      (symmetry, abstraction, contradiction) would eliminate the case split entirely.

  + THEN:
      Identify the exhaustive partition. Prove the result separately for each case. Verify
      the cases are exhaustive (no gaps) and handle any overlap. Common splits: positive/
      negative/zero, finite/infinite, convergent/divergent, trivial/non-trivial.

  + BECAUSE:
      Case analysis is often the simplest proof strategy available, even if not the most
      elegant. Many results in combinatorics, number theory, and real analysis require it
      because the underlying structure genuinely behaves differently in different regimes.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify the natural partition of your domain or hypothesis.]
    next[Verify the cases are exhaustive.]
    next[Prove each case, noting where the proof differs.]

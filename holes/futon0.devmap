## The Argument

FUTON0 is the cyborg interface layer — the membrane where human vitality becomes
stack-legible and stack state becomes human-perceivable. The Stack HUD is the
primary implementation: it reads vitality signals from existing traces (commit
times, recording cadence, Tatami sessions) and presents stack state (boundaries,
liveness, patterns, reminders) in a glanceable frame — zero extra lifelogging.
Voice-to-text, text-to-speech (podcast synthesis uses both), Kinesis board, and
the HUD demonstrate that human→stack and stack→human channels work. The
infrastructure substrate — Alacritty, Emacs, Linode, FUTON1, Org, pattern sync,
Codex, Claude — provides the plumbing. Health and alignment monitoring will
infer actual health from traces (commit times → sleep, activity → energy) plus
role alignment. Affect signals will track moments of insight and emotional
valence through logged agent sessions, sitting between futon0 and futon3.
Epistemic rhythm will establish weekly/monthly review cycles that bound WIP.
Consulting reuse will systematize proto-pattern extraction. Stack stewardship
will formalize daily practices. Futonic co-evolution will make symbolic signals
of future environments legible through Compass, with literary work entering at
that stage. Together these ground the stack's perception — the done prototypes
prove the interface works; the planned prototypes make it health-aware,
affect-sensitive, and generative.


! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Stack HUD [🙇/亏 🔃/叉]
  :maturity :settled
  :depends-on []
  :source [f0/p0]
  :evidence-for-settled [HUD used daily for 30+ days with vitality signals accurate]

  + context: The Stack HUD is the primary cyborg interface implementation.
  + IF: Human vitality leaves traces in computational systems (commits, sessions, recordings)
  + HOWEVER: These traces are scattered; stack state is distributed across futons
  + THEN: The HUD reads vitality signals and presents stack state in a glanceable frame
  + BECAUSE: Zero-friction bidirectional perception is the core cyborg promise

  + EVIDENCE:
    evidence[futon0/contrib/stack-hud.el implements vitality scanning + stack state display]
    evidence[futon0/scripts/futon0/vitality/scanner.bb runs vitality scans]
    evidence[Stack HUD logs to futon0/data/stack-hud/*.jsonl]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Refine vitality signal interpretation (commit times → sleep inference)]
    next[Add health threshold alerts to HUD warnings]

  :success-criteria
    pass[HUD displays current vitality + stack state within 2 seconds of opening]
    pass[Vitality signals update automatically when underlying data changes]

! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Bidirectional Channels [💬/口 🔊/声]
  :maturity :active
  :depends-on [f0/P1]
  :source [hdm/human-machine-dialogue]
  :evidence-for-settled [Both directions used daily; exchanges logged as reusable knowledge]

  + context: The cyborg membrane must flow both ways.
  + IF: Human→stack channels (voice, keyboard) and stack→human channels (HUD, TTS) exist
  + HOWEVER: They developed separately; not yet unified as "the interface"
  + THEN: Recognize voice-to-text, text-to-speech, Kinesis, HUD as aspects of one bidirectional membrane
  + BECAUSE: Per hdm/human-machine-dialogue — dialogue is how humans learn; embedding it aligns with practice

  + EVIDENCE:
    evidence[futon0/contrib/stack-hud.el includes voice-typing integration]
    evidence[Podcast synthesis uses both STT and TTS]
    evidence[Kinesis Advantage board is the primary tactile interface]

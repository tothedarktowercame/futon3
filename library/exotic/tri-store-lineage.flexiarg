! conclusion: Lineage uses a tri-store model: facts (append-only event log), memes (derived lineage graphs), notions (optional fuzzy index), consistent with nonstarter.
  + context: Defining how to store and query lineage/provenance information for exotic scoring.
  + IF:
    The contemplative layer needs to answer "how did this genotype arrive here?" and "is this score earned or hacked?"
  + HOWEVER:
    A single flat log is hard to query for lineage; a derived graph alone loses auditability; a fuzzy index alone lacks grounding.
  + THEN:
    Use three layers: (1) Facts = append-only event log as single source of truth (every mutation, every score, every adaptation). (2) Memes = derived lineage graph and summaries, rebuilt from facts. (3) Notions = optional fuzzy index for similarity queries. This matches the nonstarter tri-store architecture.
  + BECAUSE:
    Facts provide auditability (you can always replay). Memes provide queryability (you can ask about ancestors). Notions provide discoverability (you can find similar paths). The separation keeps each layer's guarantees clean.
    + evidence: exotic-programming-curriculum.md Basecamp decision log, Lineage storage entry; nonstarter tri-store architecture.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define fact event schema (mutation, scoring, adaptation events).
    - Implement meme derivation from facts.
    - Defer notions layer until provenance queries are clearer.

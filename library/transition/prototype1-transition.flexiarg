@title Separate FUTON0 Signals from FUTON4 Footholds
@sigils [👐/生 👋/广]

! conclusion: Separate FUTON0 Signals from FUTON4 Footholds
  + context: You are constructing a long-term working life oriented around exploration, sustainability, and alignment, rather than throughput or extraction.
  + IF:
    FUTON0 is responsible for keeping you alive and oriented (health, energy, sleep, progress, oxygen levels), and FUTON4 is responsible for making movement possible (conceptual footholds, links, tools, affordances).
  + HOWEVER:
    There is a temptation to blur these roles, which risks either false reassurance (instrumentation without traction) or unsafe exertion (traction without instrumentation).
  + THEN:
    Enforce the boundary: FUTON0 only tracks signals that answer "is continued ascent safe and worthwhile?", while FUTON4 only records structures that answer "what movements are possible from here?"
  + BECAUSE:
    Safe exploration depends on separating situational awareness from action affordance; when those collapse, judgement degrades under fatigue and complexity.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[For FUTON0, explicitly enumerate the questions you need answered to stay safe (energy, sleep debt, progress signal, recovery trend) and reject any data that does not clearly serve one of those questions.]
    next[For FUTON4, treat every hypergraph edge as a potential foothold, not a metric; its value is that it can be used later, not that it reflects current state.]
    next[Periodically check that FUTON0 never tells you how to climb and FUTON4 never tells you whether you should; if either starts doing the other’s job, you have found a fault line.]

@title Prototype 1A as Dedicated Workbench
@sigils [👍/支 👓/已]

! conclusion: Prototype 1A as Dedicated Workbench
  + context: You are using a bounded high-agency interval to construct foundational tooling intended to support many distinct future lines of work over months and years.
  + IF:
    The immediate goal is to enable sustained work on FUTON-5/6/7 rather than to directly produce their outputs.
  + HOWEVER:
    There is a persistent risk of mistaking the enabling infrastructure (base camp, workbench, prototype 1A) for either a finished product or a general-purpose appliance.
  + THEN:
    Frame success as the existence and usability of a dedicated workbench: a tool explicitly designed to make later work tractable, modifiable, and repairable under real conditions.
  + BECAUSE:
    Long-arc productivity depends less on early outputs than on having a stable locus where work can reliably begin, pause, resume, and be re-tooled without re-inventing foundations.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Articulate in one place what the workbench is for and what it explicitly is not for (no furniture, no appliances, no finished artifacts).]
    next[Treat FUTON0 instrumentation as the safety system for using the workbench, not as part of the bench itself.]
    next[Let prototype 1B be evidence-driven: repairs, reinforcements, and extensions only in response to observed strain during real FUTON-5/6/7 work, not anticipated perfection.]
    next[Use this pattern to frame Release Prototype 1 as a workbench milestone, not a finished product.]


@arg transition/persistence-conditions
@title Persistence Requires Infrastructure
@sigils [🏃/功 👎/引]

! conclusion: Persistence Requires Infrastructure
  + context: You are building foundational infrastructure (prototype 1A) intended to support long-term exploratory work rather than to directly achieve outcomes.
  + IF:
    Persistence is interpreted as continuous effort or repeated pushing upward regardless of conditions.
  + HOWEVER:
    In real terrain this behaviour is indistinguishable from foolhardiness and reliably prevents both safe summits and safe descents.
  + THEN:
    Treat prototype 1A as the construction of conditions under which persistence later becomes possible and sane.
  + BECAUSE:
    Validated persistence requires the capacity to stop, recover, resume, and change route without loss of viability, which cannot exist without prior infrastructure.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Evaluate prototype 1A only against enabling criteria (can future work start, pause, and resume safely?) rather than output metrics.]
    next[Treat any urge to push just a bit further on the infrastructure as a signal to stop and consolidate.]
    next[Assess persistence only after the workbench or base camp is used in ordinary conditions, not during its construction.]

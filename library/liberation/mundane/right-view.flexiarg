! conclusion: Hold explanatory frames provisionally — believing in causation, consequences, and the meaningfulness of action while remaining open to correction.
  + context: This operates in everyday situations requiring interpretation and decision. One needs working frames to act, but frames that calcify block learning.
  + IF:
    Action requires some explanatory frame — you cannot act without some understanding of cause and consequence.
  + HOWEVER:
    Fixed frames block feedback. But abandoning all frames leads to paralysis or nihilism ("nothing matters anyway").
  + THEN:
    Hold working frames: there IS meaning in action, there ARE consequences of conduct, there IS something to learn from feedback. But hold these as instruments, not as certainties that resist revision.
  + BECAUSE:
    Mundane right view is not wrong — it is incomplete. It partakes of good outcomes (better decisions, learning from feedback) but ripens in attachment (to being right, to the frame itself). This is better than wrong view but not yet liberation.
  + MUNDANE-CONTENT:
    - Actions have consequences (karma operates)
    - Some things genuinely help, others harm
    - Learning from experience is possible
    - Feedback channels matter
    - Correction is possible and valuable
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-WRONG-VIEW:
    Wrong view: "Nothing matters, no consequences, no learning possible"
    Mundane right view: "Things matter, consequences real, learning possible — AND I hold this provisionally"
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Notice when provisional holding tightens into certainty.
    - Use frames to act, then check outcomes against expectations.
    - Revise frames that consistently produce surprising outcomes.
  + RIPENS-IN:
    Better decisions, better relationships, reduced harm — but still within the world of views, still attached to frames that work.
  + RELATED-PATTERNS:
    - liberation/noble/right-view (the faculty beyond content)
    - eight-gates/press-mechanism (tests frame validity)

! conclusion: Not practicing-mindfulness but the mindfulness faculty operating — "mindfully they give up wrong and take up right" in one intent on the undefiled.
  + context: This operates in one developing the noble path. Mindfulness functions to monitor and guide the giving up of wrong and taking up of right — the awareness that allows course-correction.
  + IF:
    Even skillful mindfulness involves a meditator — one who takes credit for attention, who is proud of presence. Mindfulness can become another identity-project.
  + HOWEVER:
    Awareness continues — the question is whether it flows from identification or from the path functioning.
  + THEN:
    Noble right mindfulness is the awareness faculty operating in context of the path — "mindfully they give up wrong and take up right" — but the 'they' is transparent. Awareness arising as expression of path, not as personal accomplishment.
  + BECAUSE:
    Right mindfulness runs and circles around all the other factors — it is what allows each factor to be practiced with clarity rather than blindly. Noble right mindfulness is this monitoring awareness functioning without a monitor separate from the awareness.
  + TRANSCENDENT-QUALITY:
    - Not "I am being mindful" but mindfulness happening through one intent on the noble
    - Awareness that neither grasps at clarity nor avoids confusion
    - Monitoring transparent to path-factors
    - The four foundations operating without a meditator
  + THE-RUNNING-CIRCLE:
    Right mindfulness is one of the three that run and circle around all the other factors: "Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness" — the mindful giving up of wrong and taking up of right.
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-MUNDANE:
    Mundane: "I practice the four foundations" (an I practicing)
    Noble: The mindfulness faculty operating, intent on the undefiled
  + WORN-AWAY:
    "For one of right mindfulness, wrong mindfulness is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong mindfulness are worn away."

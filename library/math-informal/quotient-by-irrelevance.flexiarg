! conclusion:
  Identify what does not matter for your problem and collapse it away.

  + context: You are working with objects that carry more structure than your problem needs.
  + IF:
      Different-looking objects behave identically for your purposes, and keeping track of the
      differences creates bookkeeping overhead or case splits.

  + HOWEVER:
      Quotienting loses information. You must verify that the operations and properties you care
      about are well-defined on equivalence classes, not just on representatives.

  + THEN:
      Define an equivalence relation that identifies objects agreeing on what matters. Pass to the
      quotient. Verify well-definedness. Work in the quotient where the irrelevant distinctions
      are gone.

  + BECAUSE:
      Quotient constructions are one of the most universal moves in mathematics: integers from
      naturals, rationals from integers, homology from chains, projective space from vector space.
      Recognising when to quotient is recognising what the problem is really about.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify which distinctions between your objects are irrelevant.]
    next[Define the equivalence relation precisely.]
    next[Check that your operations respect the equivalence.]

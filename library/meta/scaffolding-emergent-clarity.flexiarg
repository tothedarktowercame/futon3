! conclusion:
  Use design-pattern scaffolds to turn drifting conversations into coherent,
  testable design knowledge that both humans and AI can edit.

  + context: You are turning open-ended collaboration into a shared, auditable design language.
  + IF:
    Complex collaborations often begin without shared structure, so reasoning
    drifts and people talk past each other.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without a disciplined format, neither human nor AI partners can maintain
    conceptual integrity; noise dominates.

  + THEN:
    Activate the design-pattern formalism at the outset—single IF/HOWEVER/THEN/
    BECAUSE/NEXT—and keep correcting drift via pattern checks.

  + BECAUSE:
    Patterns compress thought into precise, reusable units; recursive use turns
    undifferentiated conversation into structured design language while keeping
    this meta-work distinct from downstream funding or delivery governance.

  + STATUS:
    status[ready]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[When starting a new thread, log the pattern activation in the futon3 ledger and require both sides to stay inside it.]

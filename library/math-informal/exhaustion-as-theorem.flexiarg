! conclusion:
  When multiple approaches to the same proof step all fail at the same quantitative barrier,
  prove that the barrier is fundamental to the technique class, not an artifact of any
  individual approach.

  + context: You have tried several methods for a proof step (concentration inequalities,
    subsampling arguments, spectral bounds, etc.) and each gives a bound that is too weak
    by the same qualitative amount. The failure pattern is suspiciously consistent.

  + IF:
      Three or more techniques from the same family (e.g., "subsample and concentrate,"
      "bound trace then convert to operator norm," "linearize the quadratic term") all
      fail at the same quantitative step, producing bounds with the same scaling deficiency.

  + HOWEVER:
      Consistent failure might be coincidence rather than structure. Before declaring the
      barrier fundamental, verify that the techniques genuinely span the family — not just
      three variants of the same idea. Also check whether a technique outside the family
      avoids the barrier entirely.

  + THEN:
      1. Identify the common quantitative step where all techniques fail.
      2. Formulate the barrier as a theorem: "any technique in class C that proceeds via
         step X produces a bound of at most f(n)" where f(n) is weaker than the target.
      3. Prove the ceiling theorem (often by exhibiting a worst case for step X).
      4. Record the ceiling as a lemma. It eliminates the technique class and redirects
         effort toward techniques outside the class.

  + BECAUSE:
      A proved ceiling theorem is qualitatively different from "we tried 6 things and they
      didn't work." It converts empirical failure into structural understanding: the barrier
      is not a failure of ingenuity but a consequence of the technique class's structure.
      This prevents future revisitation ("maybe if we try the 7th variant...") and focuses
      effort on genuinely different approaches.

  + FAILURE-MODES:
      - Premature exhaustion claim: the family is not actually exhausted. Check that new
        techniques outside the family avoid the barrier.
      - Overgeneralization: "no concentration argument can work" when the ceiling only
        applies to trace-based certification. Scope the barrier precisely.

  + EVIDENCE:
      P6 epsilon-light subsets (futon6, Feb 2026): 6 subsample-and-concentrate techniques
      (trace/Markov, star domination, decoupling+MSS 1-shot, decoupling+MSS recursive,
      greedy/chromatic, rank spreading) all hit the quadratic-vs-linear scaling wall:
      spectral contribution scales as q² while set size scales as q. The trace-only ceiling
      was proved as a lemma (Step 1), eliminating the entire technique class and redirecting
      toward operator-norm-aware barrier greedy (a technique outside the class).

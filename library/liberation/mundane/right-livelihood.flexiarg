! conclusion: Give up wrong livelihood and earn a living by right livelihood — avoiding fawning, flattery, hinting, belittling, and using material things to chase after more.
  + context: This operates at the level of sustained patterns of material support — how one maintains physical life over time. Livelihood shapes daily activity more than any single action.
  + IF:
    Everyone needs material support, but many ways of obtaining it involve harm: trading in weapons, living creatures, meat, intoxicants, poison; or subtler corruptions like flattery and manipulation.
  + HOWEVER:
    Livelihood is constrained by circumstances — not everyone has equal access to "pure" ways of living. And renouncing all livelihood is only possible within specific institutional structures. The problem is not having needs but meeting them through harm.
  + THEN:
    Practice right livelihood by avoiding: trade in weapons, in living beings, in meat, in intoxicants, in poison. For monastics: avoiding fawning, flattery, hinting, belittling, and using material things to chase material things. Earn support through skillful means.
  + BECAUSE:
    Mundane right livelihood creates conditions for ethical life — if your living depends on harm, every day deepens complicity. But one can practice right livelihood while still attached to the identity of being "ethical" or to the security that ethical reputation provides. This is better than wrong livelihood but not yet liberation.
  + MUNDANE-CONTENT:
    - Not trading in weapons, living creatures, meat, intoxicants, poison
    - Not using manipulation, flattery, or scheming to obtain support
    - Earning support through means that don't inherently involve harm
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-WRONG-LIVELIHOOD:
    Wrong livelihood: trades in harm, manipulates for gain
    Mundane right livelihood: avoids these — AND awareness that the ethical identity can become attachment
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Audit current livelihood: what harms does it depend on?
    - Notice when livelihood-anxieties drive compromises.
    - Explore whether livelihood can shift toward less-harmful forms.
  + RIPENS-IN:
    Cleaner conscience, less complicity in harm, better material conditions for practice — but still within the world of earning and consuming, still attached to security.

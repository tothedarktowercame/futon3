@title HDM - Hyperreal Capital
@sigils [🐴/才]

! conclusion:
  treat HDM as an engine for building hyperreal capital by turning archives into traversable practice.

  + context: You are turning mathematical knowledge into operational skill for more people.
  + IF:
      Mathematicians hold "real" capital (papers, code, reputation) and "hyperreal" capital (internalised moves
      that let them navigate spaces, solve problems, and generate results).

  + HOWEVER:
      Access to real capital is uneven, and opaque formats or turgid writing make it hard to convert real capital
      into hyperreal capital, especially for students or people outside well-resourced institutions.

  + THEN:
    Treat HDM as an engine for generating and distributing hyperreal capital: provide patterns, examples,
    traversable proof landscapes, and training grounds that deliver operational understanding over mere citation.
    Measure success by how easily newcomers can move in a domain.

  + BECAUSE:
      Mathematical value lies in what people (and agents) can *do*; HDM should lower the barrier from "reading" to
      "acting."
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Link FUTON6 explicitly to FUTON3 training grounds; treat learning trails as first-class scholia.]
    next[Design seed domains with pedagogy in mind, not just archival fidelity.]
    next[Develop simple metrics for movement capability (e.g. time to solve standard tasks with HDM support).]

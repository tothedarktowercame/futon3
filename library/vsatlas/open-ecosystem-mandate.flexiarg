! conclusion:
  Publish core components under open licences, cultivate a distributed developer community, and document governance primitives.

  + context: You are considering whether there is a strategic requirement that the platform’s foundations remain open, forkable, and governable to support long-term collective authorship.
  + IF:
    Centralised proprietary systems limit trust, adoption, and collaboration.

  + HOWEVER:
    Multi-author worlds require transparent, forkable, and collectively governed foundations.

  + THEN:
    Publish core components under open licences, cultivate a distributed developer community, and document governance primitives.

  + BECAUSE:
    Only an open ecosystem can support pluriversality, collective authorship, and long-term resilience.

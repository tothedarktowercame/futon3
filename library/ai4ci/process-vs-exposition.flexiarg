! conclusion:
  Recognise that the project studies two complementary sources of reasoning
  information in mathematical texts: the exploratory process signals that hint
  at how a proof was found, and the expository signals intentionally placed in
  published work to help readers reconstruct the logic.

  + context: You are clarifying the two evidence sources the pilot will annotate and compare.
  + IF:
    Human understanding of mathematics relies on both the implicit heuristics
    behind a proof ("try this", "by analogy") and the explicit narrative cues
    authors include in published solutions ("note that", "it is natural to
    consider").

  + HOWEVER:
    Process cues are often partial or suppressed, while expository cues are
    fragmentary and uneven across texts; neither source alone provides a stable
    representation of the reasoning structure that learners reconstruct.

  + THEN:
    Analyse both kinds of cues: use baseline entity and relation extraction to
    anchor formal steps, and annotate how each informal phrase—whether exploratory
    or expository—links to specific objects, steps, or subgoals in the proof.

  + BECAUSE:
    Process cues reveal the reasoning that originally generated the proof, while
    expository cues reveal how experts communicate that reasoning to others; the
    combination provides the richest available evidence for reconstructing
    mid-level structure without requiring access to the original scratch work.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Distinguish and label exploratory vs. expository cues in the annotated dataset.]
    next[Test with seminar participants how each type supports understanding.]
    next[Report which signals form reliable scaffolds for mathematical explanation.]

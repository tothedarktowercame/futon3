! corollary: Role × Value invariants that must be preserved in transformation

  + because: We ARE diverse stakeholders interacting with the research ecosystem,
             and we BELIEVE in Inclusivity,
    + lemma: Infrastructure must support plural forms of visibility and contribution.
    + instantiated-by: Different deposit workflows, object types, permissions,
                       and metadata needs across Depositors, Archivists, Students.
    + therefore: Any transformation must preserve multi-voiced participation.

  + because: We ARE accountable actors (Governance, Assessors, Archivists, Students),
             and we BELIEVE in Confidence and Responsibility,
    + lemma: The repository must make research trustworthy by design.
    + instantiated-by: Requirements for audit trails, rights metadata,
                       ethical checks, embargo governance.
    + therefore: Transparency and clarity must remain invariants of the system.

  + because: We ARE creators (Depositors) and reusers (Downloaders),
             and we BELIEVE in Enterprising Creativity and Connectedness,
    + lemma: Infrastructure must support flexible, linkable, cross-disciplinary reuse.
    + instantiated-by: Need for metadata openness, interdisciplinary connections,
                       APIs, stable identifiers, reuse signals.
    + therefore: Interoperability and linkability cannot be sacrificed.

  + because: We ARE a community producing and sharing research,
             and we BELIEVE in Generosity of Spirit,
    + lemma: The repository must reduce friction and support sharing without penalty.
    + instantiated-by: Workflows that minimise administrative load and allow
                       easy, fair contribution.
    + therefore: Contribution must remain low-friction and non-punitive.

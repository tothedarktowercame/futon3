! conclusion:
  Introduce a stewardship layer—human or automated roles that approve, edit, or retire arcs based on clear criteria.

  + context: You need explicit roles or processes to curate and manage links, so openness does not undermine coherence or safety. This does not apply when contribution volume is low and trust is already high.
  + IF:
    Open contribution environments generate noise, drift, and potential misuse.

  + HOWEVER:
    Accepting every proposed link collapses the manifold into clutter or abuse.

  + THEN:
    Introduce a stewardship layer—human or automated roles that approve, edit, or retire arcs based on clear criteria.

  + BECAUSE:
    Stewardship preserves coherence, safety, and long-term navigability.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define a minimal stewardship checklist for approving new arcs.]
    next[Name the first steward role and the threshold for retirement.]
    next[Define a volume signal (e.g., links/day) that triggers stewardship activation.]

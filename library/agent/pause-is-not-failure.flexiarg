! conclusion: Stopping to request clarification or expanded scope is a valid action, not a defect.
  + context: An agent encounters ambiguity, uncertainty, or boundary conditions during execution.
  + IF:
    The agent cannot proceed confidently without information or authorization it doesn't have.
  + HOWEVER:
    Agents that never pause either over-commit (bulldozing through uncertainty) or silently drift (making up answers). Both erode trust.
  + THEN:
    Treat "pause and ask" as a first-class action with defined triggers: ambiguous requirements, scope boundary reached, confidence below threshold, resource budget near exhaustion. Emit pause events with context for resumption (reason, missing info, requested decision, scope impact, confidence/budget snapshot).
  + BECAUSE:
    Pausing surfaces uncertainty to those who can resolve it. An agent that pauses appropriately is more trustworthy than one that always "succeeds."
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define explicit pause triggers for your agent (don't rely on ad-hoc judgment).
    - Design pause events that carry enough context for efficient resumption.
    - Track pause frequency as a diagnostic: too many suggests unclear scope; zero suggests over-confidence.

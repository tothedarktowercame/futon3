! conclusion:
  if you want rapid open-world ingest but also coherent state, validate aggressively and provide repair tooling

  + context: futon1 hardened open-world ingest and added repair scripts after ingest drift.
  + IF:
    you want to ingest background knowledge quickly

  + HOWEVER:
    you also need open-world data to remain coherent and mirrorable

  + THEN:
    enforce strict validation on ingest and supply repair/backfill scripts for recovery

  + BECAUSE:
    unvalidated open-world ingest caused drift and required repair pathways

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]

    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L135]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define open-world validation rules and error reporting.]
    next[Add tests that assert open-world fields are mirrored into XTDB.]

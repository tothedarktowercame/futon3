! conclusion: 以轉接器在不改動既有介面的前提下完成整合。
  + context: A component must integrate with a dependency that has an incompatible interface.
  + if: You want to avoid rewriting the dependency or polluting core logic with conversions.
  + however: Directly sprinkling translation code across callers causes duplication and brittle coupling.
  + then: Create a dedicated adapter that translates between the expected interface and the dependency’s interface, and keep the adapter as the only integration boundary.
  + because: A single translation boundary isolates change and preserves clean contracts.
  + next-steps:
    - Add contract tests around the adapter to prove compatibility and catch upstream changes.
    - evidence-shape: {:adapter/name :string, :adapter/src :string, :adapter/dst :string, :adapter/tests [:string]}

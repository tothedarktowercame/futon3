! instantiated-by: License Laddering
  + context: In Open Research projects, licensing choices often stall progress and collaboration.
    + if: You want maximal remixability while preserving dignity and attribution.
    + but: Legal anxiety and moral caution create paralysis.
    + then: Begin from a permissive default and establish a clear sequence of license “steps” that can be tightened later as needed.
    + because: Progressive licensing reduces fear-driven restriction and allows flexibility as the project matures.

! instantiated-by: License-as-Story
  + context: Standard boilerplate licenses fail to communicate intent or social meaning.
    + if: You want reciprocity and lineage rather than mere compliance.
    + but: Legal phrasing alienates non-specialists.
    + then: Pair each formal licence with a short human-readable narrative explaining purpose, values, and intended reuse.
    + because: Narrative notes increase understanding and encourage constructive, informed reuse.

! instantiated-by: Platform Choreography
  + context: Multiple systems and platforms coexist within an open-research ecosystem.
    + if: Users need smooth traversal across platforms.
    + but: Fragmented workflows create bottlenecks and inconsistent expectations.
    + then: Map the handoffs explicitly; define how each platform signals readiness, completion, or needs for follow-up.

! instantiated-by: Friction-as-Feature
  + context: Removing all friction from research workflows can obscure important decision points.
    + if: You seek smoothness and automation.
    + but: Critical judgments (ethics, consent, quality control) require deliberation.
    + then: Introduce intentional micro-frictions to prompt reflection where it is necessary.
    + because: Well-placed friction protects integrity and prevents premature or careless decisions.

! instantiated-by: Bridge-Before-Portal
  + context: Researchers often encounter new systems without preparation.
    + if: You want newcomers to engage meaningfully.
    + but: They arrive without context or confidence.
    + then: Provide a low-stakes bridge (orientation, sandbox, sample objects) before requiring formal deposit or registration.
    + because: Early, low-pressure exposure increases willingness to adopt and reduces confusion.

! instantiated-by: Snapshot-with-Story DOI
  + context: DOIs capture snapshots but lack contextual meaning.
    + if: You want persistent identifiers to convey purpose.
    + but: A DOI alone does not express narrative or reasoning.
    + then: Pair each snapshot with a short contextual note explaining what changed and why.

  + context: Identifiers (DOI, ORCID, ROR) accumulate unevenly across projects.
    + if: You want transparent provenance.
    + but: Identifier management decays without stewardship.
    + then: Maintain a curated “garden” of identifiers with assigned stewards and regular review.

! instantiated-by: Two-Stage Fidelity (Registered Rhythm)
  + context: Evaluating open research processes requires evidence of both intention and execution.
    + if: You want training programmes to be accountable.
    + but: Single-stage assessment hides drift between plans and actions.
    + then: Use a two-stage rhythm: registration of intentions followed by verification of delivery.
    + because: Separating intent from execution provides clearer evaluation and reduces ambiguity.

    + if: You want clarity in training and auditability.
    + but: Combined method-documents obscure both practice and record.

    + if: You want credit to reflect actual labour.

    + if: You want iterative development.
    + but: Funding portals impose high thresholds.

    + if: You want inclusive talent development.
    + but: No pathways lead from peripheral engagement to core roles.

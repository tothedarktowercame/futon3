# pattern	okipona	truth	rationale	hotwords
agent/budget-bounds-exploration	mani	分	Budget Bounds Exploration -> mani/分: Budgets convert open-ended search into bounded decisions, making progress measurable and preventing silent resource drain.	budget, bounds, exploration, agent, budgets, convert, open, ended, search, bounded
agent/commitment-varies-with-confidence	lukin	认	Commitment Varies With Confidence -> lukin/认: Variable commitment adapts behavior to epistemic state. The agent exploits when it knows enough and explores (or asks) when it doesn't.	commitment, varies, confidence, agent, variable, adapts, behavior, epistemic, state, exploits
agent/coordination-has-cost	kulupu	功	Coordination Has Cost -> kulupu/功: Cost-aware coordination prevents both under-use (never asking for help when stuck) and over-use (constant interruption). It respects the resources of collaborators.	coordination, cost, agent, aware, prevents, both, under, use, never, asking
agent/environment-over-optimization	kin	本	Environment Over Optimization -> kin/本: Viable environments enable open-ended evolution. Instead of one optimal agent, you get a population of approaches that can be compared, combined, and adapted. The environment becomes the product, not any single agent.	environment, over, optimization, agent, viable, environments, enable, open, ended, evolution
agent/escalation-cost-vs-risk	wawa	平	Escalation Cost vs Risk -> wawa/平: This preserves speed on low-stakes actions while protecting high-stakes decisions.	escalation, cost, vs, risk, agent, preserves, speed, low, stakes, actions
agent/evidence-over-assertion	lipu	示	Evidence Over Assertion -> lipu/示: Evidence transforms agent output from "trust me" to "check this." It enables verification, correction, and cumulative trust-building.	evidence, over, assertion, agent, transforms, output, trust, me, check, enables
agent/handoff-preserves-context	pana	代	Handoff Preserves Context -> pana/代: Handoffs convert ephemeral session state into persistent project state. They enable distributed and asynchronous work without context collapse.	handoff, preserves, context, agent, handoffs, convert, ephemeral, session, state, persistent
agent/intent-handshake-is-binding	ona	令	Intent Handshake Is Binding -> ona/令: Binding intent makes the run auditable and prevents silent goal drift.	intent, handshake, binding, agent, makes, run, auditable, prevents, silent, goal
agent/pause-is-not-failure	lape	不	Pause Is Not Failure -> lape/不: Pausing surfaces uncertainty to those who can resolve it. An agent that pauses appropriately is more trustworthy than one that always "succeeds."	pause, failure, agent, pausing, surfaces, uncertainty, those, who, resolve, pauses
agent/provisional-claims-ledger	lipu	未	Provisional Claims Ledger -> lipu/未: A ledger turns uncertainty into actionable follow-up rather than silent drift.	provisional, claims, ledger, agent, turns, uncertainty, actionable, follow, up, rather
agent/scope-before-action	supa	内	Scope Before Action -> supa/内: Declared scope makes progress measurable, side effects auditable, and completion definable. It also protects the broader system from unintended changes.	scope, before, action, agent, declared, makes, progress, measurable, side, effects
agent/sense-deliberate-act	sike	工	Sense-Deliberate-Act Cycle -> sike/工: The three-phase structure prevents both impulsive drift and endless deliberation, and makes the agent's reasoning inspectable at phase boundaries.	sense, deliberate, act, cycle, agent, three, phase, structure, prevents, both
agent/state-is-hypothesis	insa	计	State Is Hypothesis -> insa/计: Hypothesis-framed state makes the agent self-correcting: surprises trigger learning rather than denial or breakdown.	state, hypothesis, agent, framed, makes, self, correcting, surprises, trigger, learning
agent/trail-enables-return	nasin	归	Trail Enables Return -> nasin/归: Trails convert ephemeral navigation into persistent structure. They enable learning, debugging, and graceful recovery.	trail, enables, return, agent, trails, convert, ephemeral, navigation, persistent, structure
ai4ci/ai-core-function	sama	未	AI Incorporation — Core Function -> sama/未: This deployment keeps AI in the role of suggestion engine while ensuring that every retained explanation has a traceable record and a human steward, turning dispersed expository text into candidate reasoning scaffolds that future training-oriented AI could build on.	ai, incorporation, core, function, ai4ci, deployment, keeps, role, suggestion, engine
ai4ci/ai-method-role	sama	未	AI Incorporation — Methodological Role -> sama/未: Methodological validity in this setting depends on showing that human judgement governs every explanation and that the resulting log reveals which explanation types AI handles reliably and which remain beyond its current competence.	ai, incorporation, methodological, role, ai4ci, method, validity, setting, depends, showing
ai4ci/collective-intelligence-evaluation	palisa	上	Collective Intelligence — Evaluative Lens -> palisa/上: Collective intelligence is evidenced when diverse readers reach a workable shared understanding of the argument; only structured discussion around common artefacts can reveal whether the extracted reasoning cues support this outcome.	collective, intelligence, evaluative, lens, ai4ci, evaluation, evidenced, when, diverse, readers
ai4ci/collective-intelligence-framing	jelo	仁	Collective Intelligence — Communication Framing -> jelo/仁: Collective intelligence depends on inspectable, cross-referenced intermediate artefacts; without them, seminars slide back into folklore and private interpretations instead of testing and refining the shared reasoning layer.	collective, intelligence, communication, framing, ai4ci, depends, inspectable, cross, referenced, intermediate
ai4ci/dual-layer-proof-patterns	toki	二	Dual-Layer Proof Patterns as a Feasibility Question -> toki/二: Human-validated cue logs and coded seminar transcripts provide evidence—not speculation—about which pattern fragments are stable, which are fragile, and what methodological constraints govern scalability.	dual, layer, proof, patterns, feasibility, question, ai4ci, human, validated, cue
ai4ci/funding-justification	kulupu	匀	Funding Justification — Rapid-Response Pilot Scale -> kulupu/匀: Reviewers need to see that the funds unlock a focused test of the reasoning-layer hypothesis, not an open-ended attempt to build a new platform.	funding, justification, rapid, response, pilot, scale, ai4ci, reviewers, need, see
ai4ci/pilot-feasibility	poka	六	Feasibility — Six-Month Pilot Discipline -> poka/六: Dhammavicaya (keen investigation) in this context demands evidence that the pilot answers a clear methodological question—whether a recoverable reasoning layer exists—rather than attempting production-grade systems.	feasibility, six, month, pilot, discipline, ai4ci, dhammavicaya, keen, investigation, context
ai4ci/process-vs-exposition	tu	才	Process and Exposition as Complementary Evidence -> tu/才: Process cues reveal the reasoning that originally generated the proof, while expository cues reveal how experts communicate that reasoning to others; the combination provides the richest available evidence for reconstructing mid-level structure without requiring access to the original scratch work.	process, exposition, complementary, evidence, ai4ci, vs, cues, reveal, reasoning, originally
ai4ci/project-summary-core	poka	才	AI4CI — Mid-Level Reasoning Pilot -> poka/才: Once we know whether a stable mid-level reasoning layer can be captured from exposition—and where it breaks down—we can state clearly what kind of process-level data will be needed for future AI that aims to train humans, and what cannot be obtained from textual traces alone.	ai4ci, mid, level, reasoning, pilot, project, summary, core, once, know
ai4ci/proof-pattern-hierarchy	li	今	Proof Patterns as a Hypothesised Mid-Level Hierarchy -> li/今: If such fragments can be identified and linked to specific objects and steps, they provide the first empirical foothold on an underlying proof- pattern hierarchy, even if only at a local scale. If they cannot, this reveals real limits on what present methods can recover.	proof, patterns, hypothesised, mid, level, hierarchy, ai4ci, pattern, such, fragments
ai4ci/sota-distinction	palisa	未	Distinguishing This Project from Current Mathematical AI SOTA -> palisa/未: Explanation and understanding depend on reconstructing intermediate motivations and relationships, not on producing correct final answers. Current SOTA models offer limited guidance here, leaving a gap that this pilot is uniquely positioned to explore.	distinguishing, project, current, mathematical, ai, sota, ai4ci, distinction, explanation, understanding
ai4ci/technical-grounding	lawa	了	Technical Grounding — From NER/RE to Informal Structure -> lawa/了: This isolates the real research question—whether human-recognisable reasoning structure can be recovered from exposition—from the underlying engineering, avoiding overclaim about what current NLP can deliver on its own.	technical, grounding, ner, re, informal, structure, ai4ci, isolates, real, research
ai4ci/umbrella	tawa	支	AI4CI — Human-Centred Future of AI -> tawa/支: Only by making this tacit reasoning layer explicit can we both deepen our scientific understanding of how humans communicate complex thinking and provide the process-level structures that future AI will need in order to help people build expertise rather than merely reproduce correct answers.	ai4ci, human, centred, future, ai, umbrella, only, making, tacit, reasoning
aif/belief-state-operational-hypotheses	linja	双	Belief State as Operational Hypotheses -> linja/双: A compact belief state makes predict -> observe -> update implementable and testable.	belief, state, operational, hypotheses, aif, compact, makes, predict, observe, update
aif/candidate-pattern-action-space	ken	力	Candidate Pattern Action Space -> ken/力: Constraining the action space makes downstream scoring meaningful rather than performative.	candidate, pattern, action, space, aif, constraining, makes, downstream, scoring, meaningful
aif/evidence-precision-registry	taso	由	Evidence Precision Registry -> taso/由: Making precision explicit turns trust into a tunable control surface rather than an undocumented bias.	evidence, precision, registry, aif, making, explicit, turns, trust, tunable, control
aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard	lili	专	Expected Free Energy as Multi-Term Scorecard -> lili/专: A decomposed G makes disagreements concrete (which term dominated) and enables targeted adjustment.	expected, free, energy, multi, term, scorecard, aif, decomposed, g, makes
aif/policy-precision-commitment-temperature	moku	由	Policy Precision as Commitment Temperature -> moku/由: A single commitment dial allows systematic control of stochasticity without changing the scoring model.	policy, precision, commitment, temperature, aif, single, dial, allows, systematic, control
aif/structured-observation-vector	ilo	了	Structured Observation Vector -> ilo/了: A stable observation vector is the prerequisite for meaningful precision control and policy scoring.	structured, observation, vector, aif, stable, prerequisite, meaningful, precision, control, policy
aif/term-to-channel-traceability	tawa	功	Term-to-Channel Traceability -> tawa/功: Explicit term-to-channel linkage prevents semantic drift in scoring terms and makes policy behavior mechanically inspectable.	term, channel, traceability, aif, explicit, linkage, prevents, semantic, drift, scoring
ants/baseline-cyber-ant	taso	三	Baseline Cyber-AIF Ant -> taso/三: Once the narrative and fixtures exist as pattern assets, Futon5 can attach a `:cyber/baseline` operator that emits an AIF config identical to Futon2’s defaults, making cyber-ants “pattern flashed” twins of the current species.	baseline, cyber, aif, ant, ants, once, narrative, fixtures, exist, pattern
ants/cargo-return-discipline	supa	归	Cargo Return Discipline Pattern -> supa/归: The same logic applies to graph walkers (deliver package, reward commit) or any pattern that alternates gather/deliver phases.	cargo, return, discipline, pattern, ants, same, logic, applies, graph, walkers
ants/hunger-precision-coupling	sewi	六	Hunger ↔ Precision Coupling Pattern -> sewi/六: Futon5 needs those declarative mappings to export a faithful cyber-ant affect config; otherwise the new agents would drift away from the proven hunger dynamics.	hunger, precision, coupling, pattern, ants, futon5, needs, those, declarative, mappings
ants/pheromone-trail-tuner	kin	去	Adaptive Trail Tuner Pattern -> kin/去: The same principle applies to graph walkers emitting hints or proofs: you want signaling to adapt to novelty and resource pressure.	adaptive, trail, tuner, pattern, ants, pheromone, same, principle, applies, graph
ants/white-space-scout	loje	刊	White-Space Scout Pattern -> loje/刊: Futon5 needs the declarative rule (“white space implies scout stance”) so it can flash cyber-ants or future agents with the same homing instinct.	white, space, scout, pattern, ants, futon5, needs, declarative, rule, implies
code-coherence/dead-code-hygiene	mute	本	Dead Code Hygiene -> mute/本: Dhammavicaya requires that “what the system does” and “what the devmap claims” match; dead code collapses that link.	dead, code, hygiene, coherence, dhammavicaya, requires, what, system, does, devmap
contributing/devmap-contribution-protocol	mute	工	Devmap Contribution Protocol -> mute/工: keeping `next[...]` hooks and futon-level state current is how humans and FUTON3’s coherence checks agree on what changed and what to do next.	devmap, contribution, protocol, contributing, keeping, next, hooks, futon, level, state
contributing/stack-scan-logging-protocol	len	本	Stack Coherence Scan Logging Protocol -> len/本: dhammavicaya demands observable progress; consistent scan logs let us compare runs, tighten feedback loops, and hand future contributors the exact history of what was checked and why.	stack, coherence, scan, logging, protocol, contributing, dhammavicaya, demands, observable, progress
control/agential-efficiency-measurement	seli	功	Agential Efficiency Measurement -> seli/功: (1) Planetary: Energy efficiency matters. If agential coding is less efficient than human coding, that's a real cost. (2) Economic: People will pay for proven efficiency gains. Unmeasured efficiency is a claim, not a fact. (3) Optimization: You can only improve what you measure. Metrics reveal where agents waste tokens on unproductive loops.	agential, efficiency, measurement, control, 1, planetary, energy, matters, coding, less
control/agential-oss-infrastructure	ilo	本	Agential Open Source Infrastructure -> ilo/本: Human OSS relies on tacit learning loops (code review norms, testing practices, maintainer judgment acquired through socialization). Agents don't learn through socialization — their learning loops must be explicit, machine-checkable, and auditable. This makes certain economic and coordination patterns visible that were previously implicit.	agential, open, source, infrastructure, control, oss, human, relies, tacit, learning
control/agential-pattern-hygiene	telo	水	Agential Pattern Hygiene -> telo/水: Patterns can increase in quality through use and become living documents that reflect learned experience, rather than degrading into unmaintained dumping grounds. This keeps the library curated and trustworthy.	agential, pattern, hygiene, control, patterns, increase, quality, through, use, become
control/effort-estimation	tenpo	计	Effort Estimation with Token & Human Time -> tenpo/计: This format is machine-readable, separates concerns (reading vs building vs checking), makes token budgets explicit, and flags uncertainty via confidence	effort, estimation, token, human, time, control, format, machine, readable, separates
corps/carrying-ones-own-question	pilin	心	Carrying One's Own Question (Apprentice → Independent Investigator) -> pilin/心: Independence is not the absence of supervision; it is the presence of a clearly owned line of inquiry. Making ownership visible strengthens confidence, clarifies expectations, and aligns supervisory teams around the researcher’s judgement.	carrying, one, s, own, question, apprentice, independent, investigator, corps, ones
corps/five-arrows-fit	pali	五	Relationship to existing doctoral training -> pali/五: The five transitions—student to colleague; apprentice to independent investigator; individual contributor to collaborative team member; private learner to public practitioner; project-focused worker to systems-aware researcher—already occur within doctoral pathways, but without a shared framework they are difficult to recognise, support, or evaluate. Making these transitions explicit helps align supervisory expectations with cohort development and with the institutional research culture that doctoral programmes aim to foster.	relationship, existing, doctoral, training, corps, five, arrows, fit, transitions, student
corps/letting-the-trace-teach	pana	文	Letting the Trace Teach (Private Learning → Public-Facing Identity) -> pana/文: Public-facing traces signal identity and invite collaboration; they provide low-risk entry points for others to understand, support, or extend the researcher’s work while helping the researcher build confidence as a contributor.	letting, trace, teach, private, learning, public, facing, identity, corps, traces
corps/seeing-the-surrounding-conditions	ale	田	Seeing the Surrounding Conditions (Project → System) -> ale/田: Systems-level awareness improves decision quality, anticipates bottlenecks, and prepares researchers for future roles with broader responsibility by teaching how individual work affects the collective environment.	seeing, surrounding, conditions, project, system, corps, systems, level, awareness, improves
corps/standing-in-the-circle	ona	仁	Standing in the Circle (Student → Colleague) -> ona/仁: Explicit reasoning creates recognition: supervisors and peers can respond at the appropriate level, collaboration becomes more mature, and the researcher internalises professional discourse norms that move them from student to colleague.	standing, circle, student, colleague, corps, explicit, reasoning, creates, recognition, supervisors
corps/working-where-others-can-see	oko	示	Working Where Others Can See (Individual Contributor → Collaborative Team Member) -> oko/示: Collaboration relies on visible work surfaces. When intermediate steps are reviewable, teams reduce duplication, coordinate effectively, and offer support before issues harden into blockers.	working, where, others, see, individual, contributor, collaborative, team, member, corps
devmap-coherence/baseline-freeze	walo	四	Baseline Freeze & Audit Hooks -> walo/四: dhammavicaya is about investigating what *already* exists; without explicit freezes and audit hooks, every promise of determinism becomes oral history	baseline, freeze, audit, hooks, devmap, coherence, dhammavicaya, investigating, what, already
devmap-coherence/devmap-scope-discipline	supa	工	Devmap Scope Discipline -> supa/工: sharp scope makes layers composable and keeps stack blockers observable.	devmap, scope, discipline, coherence, sharp, makes, layers, composable, keeps, stack
devmap-coherence/ifr-f0-sati	lon	亏	IFR — FUTON0 Mindful Apprehension (sati) -> lon/亏: sati is the quality of presence that makes all other factors possible; FUTON0 must prove its signals are actually reaching the stack, not just claimed	ifr, futon0, mindful, apprehension, sati, devmap, coherence, f0, quality, presence
devmap-coherence/ifr-f1-dhammavicaya	oko	乃	IFR — FUTON1 Graph Memory Seed (dhammavicaya) -> oko/乃: without codified dhammavicaya, higher futons cannot inspect “the system model of me” with confidence	ifr, futon1, graph, memory, seed, dhammavicaya, devmap, coherence, f1, without
devmap-coherence/ifr-f2-viriya	lili	己	IFR — FUTON2 Active Inference Energy (viriya) -> lili/己: viriya means kinetic collaboration—without these hooks, energy cannot circulate through the stack	ifr, futon2, active, inference, energy, viriya, devmap, coherence, f2, means
devmap-coherence/ifr-f3-piti	alasa	心	IFR — FUTON3 Flexiformal Proofwork (pīti) -> alasa/心: pīti is the pleasure of effective action; FUTON3 must constantly show that pattern checks move real obligations forward	ifr, futon3, flexiformal, proofwork, p, ti, devmap, coherence, f3, piti
devmap-coherence/ifr-f3a-piti-audit	nasin	止	IFR — FUTON3A Pattern Guidance & Audit (pīti-audit) -> nasin/止: pīti-audit extends pīti (joy of effective action) to the audit layer itself — futon3a must prove it can coordinate the stack, not just log events	ifr, futon3a, pattern, guidance, audit, p, ti, devmap, coherence, f3a
devmap-coherence/ifr-f4-passaddhi	kepeken	工	IFR — FUTON4 GravPad / Memory Atelier (passaddhi) -> kepeken/工: passaddhi keeps the system from running hot; this layer must prove it can settle the energy from F3/F2	ifr, futon4, gravpad, memory, atelier, passaddhi, devmap, coherence, f4, keeps
devmap-coherence/ifr-f5-samadhi	seli	己	IFR — FUTON5 Nonstarter / Concentration Engine (samādhi) -> seli/己: samādhi is the gathering of power—F5 must show that concentrated practice is actively linked to the proofwork	ifr, futon5, nonstarter, concentration, engine, sam, dhi, devmap, coherence, f5
devmap-coherence/ifr-f6-upekkha	supa	十	IFR — FUTON6 Hyperreal Argumentarium (upekkhā) -> supa/十: upekkhā here means balanced reasoning—F6 must remain a calm curator of math, not another sandbox	ifr, futon6, hyperreal, argumentarium, upekkh, devmap, coherence, f6, upekkha, here
devmap-coherence/ifr-f7-upa-upekkha	kule	义	IFR — FUTON7 Civic Field of Wisdom (upa-upekkhā) -> kule/义: upa-upekkhā is balance beyond balance—F7 must prove that distributed practice actually shapes civic institutions	ifr, futon7, civic, field, wisdom, upa, upekkh, devmap, coherence, f7
devmap-coherence/ifr-state-convergence	kin	广	IFR–State Convergence Check -> kin/广: dhammavicaya requires evidence for keeping a layer active.	ifr, state, convergence, check, devmap, coherence, dhammavicaya, requires, evidence, keeping
devmap-coherence/next-steps-to-done	oko	本	Next Steps to Done -> oko/本: dhammavicaya requires observable movement—without a maintained “next step” ledger the roadmap becomes inert prose and the proof engine cannot certify progress toward done	next, steps, done, devmap, coherence, dhammavicaya, requires, observable, movement, without
devmap-coherence/prototype-alignment-bridge	wawa	工	Prototype Alignment — Context & Bridge Check -> wawa/工: pattern-capable agents need bridges-before-portals (per p4ng) and explicit pattern activation surfaces to keep prototypes more than aspirational	prototype, alignment, context, bridge, check, devmap, coherence, pattern, capable, agents
devmap-coherence/prototype-alignment-embedding	supa	工	Prototype Alignment — Semantic Embedding Discipline -> supa/工: embedding discipline lets pattern-capable agents trust similarity queries and keeps the system replicable	prototype, alignment, semantic, embedding, discipline, devmap, coherence, lets, pattern, capable
devmap-coherence/prototype-alignment-role	ona	己	Prototype Alignment — Role Reveal & Stewardship -> ona/己: Prototype stories must be legible to pattern-capable agents and maintainers; clear roles enable coordination, care, and accountability	prototype, alignment, role, reveal, stewardship, devmap, coherence, stories, legible, pattern
devmap-coherence/prototype-alignment-tension	wawa	义	Prototype Alignment — Tension & Readiness Check -> wawa/义: Surfacing tensions (per p4ng) and defining readiness windows keep prototypes testable and prevent surprise failures downstream	prototype, alignment, tension, readiness, check, devmap, coherence, surfacing, tensions, per
devmap-coherence/prototype-maturity-lifecycle	suli	升	Prototype Maturity Lifecycle -> suli/升: dhammavicaya requires knowing what you're investigating; maturity tags make the epistemic status of each prototype explicit and auditable	prototype, maturity, lifecycle, devmap, coherence, dhammavicaya, requires, knowing, what, re
devmap-coherence/prototype-structure-checklist	lipu	工	Prototype Structure Checklist -> lipu/工: Why this approach (the warrant)	prototype, structure, checklist, devmap, coherence, why, approach, warrant, require, every
devmap-coherence/status-keywords	kin	本	Devmap Status Keywords -> kin/本: a precise, repeatable mapping keeps devmap reviews consistent and allows automated triage without losing epistemic nuance.	devmap, status, keywords, coherence, precise, repeatable, mapping, keeps, reviews, consistent
dsc/appendix-epistemic-bridge	monsi	刊	Appendix as Epistemic Bridge -> monsi/刊: Advanced theses often assume competence first and offer theory as a means of interpretation, not justification.	appendix, epistemic, bridge, dsc, advanced, theses, often, assume, competence, first
dsc/evidence-situated-log	kin	了	Evidence as Situated Log, Not Exhibit -> kin/了: Doctor of Science–level work values traceability and sustained engagement over curated minimalism. - evidence: /home/joe/code/futon5/TICKETS-mission-0.md - Mission 0 ticket log kept in futon5 as local evidence. - evidence: /home/joe/code/futon5/resources/exotic-programming-notebook-iii.org - Notebook updates captured as situated logs in futon5.	evidence, situated, log, exhibit, dsc, doctor, science, level, work, values
dsc/traversal-first-chaptering	weka	甲	Traversal-First Chaptering -> weka/甲: A Doctor of Science thesis validates breadth with depth by demonstrating sustained, situated competence across multiple domains rather than a single proof thread.	traversal, first, chaptering, dsc, doctor, science, thesis, validates, breadth, depth
eight-gates/an-push	seme	力	Àn: Push -> seme/力: Exploit policy (goal-focused forward motion) only works when the whole preference model is aligned—scope verified, risks acknowledged, desired futures clear. Pushing without alignment is flailing. Structural push transforms situations.	n, push, eight, gates, exploit, policy, goal, focused, forward, motion
eight-gates/cai-pluck	kala	爪	Cǎi: Pluck -> kala/爪: Grounding transforms "trust me" into "check this." Evidence anchors are the earth that floating claims need. Plucking is the act of connecting abstraction to reality, not by opposing the abstraction but by giving it a path down.	c, i, pluck, eight, gates, cai, grounding, transforms, trust, me
eight-gates/elbow-immediate	wawa	力	Elbow: Immediate Intervention -> wawa/力: Zhǒu is a close-range strike that doesn't require full extension or commitment. In security terms: we can intervene quickly without committing to a full judgment. This is tactical — stop the bleeding first, diagnose later. The smallness of elbow energy means we intervene precisely on the current action, not the pattern as a whole.	elbow, immediate, intervention, eight, gates, zh, u, close, range, strike
eight-gates/ji-press	li	力	Jǐ: Press -> li/力: Patterns have focal tensions—the IF/HOWEVER pair that defines when they apply. Pressing means engaging that specific tension fully rather than addressing the pattern superficially. Compression at the right point releases transformation.	j, press, eight, gates, ji, patterns, focal, tensions, however, pair
eight-gates/kao-lean	nena	山	Kào: Lean -> nena/山: Environment over optimization: sometimes you don't need a clever technique, you need to bring your whole context to bear. Handoff preserves context because it's structural—the trunk of accumulated state, not just the hands of immediate action.	k, o, lean, eight, gates, kao, environment, over, optimization, sometimes
eight-gates/lean-commit	nena	山	Lean: Full Commitment Escalation -> nena/山: Kào uses the whole body's structure and weight. In security terms: when precision fails, structural response is needed. This is not a failure of the security layer — it's the correct response when a fabrication template has demonstrated resistance to lower escalation levels. The weight of Kào means the response is proportional to the confirmed threat.	lean, full, commitment, escalation, eight, gates, commit, k, o, uses
eight-gates/lie-split	kipisi	分	Liè: Split -> kipisi/分: Tensions in patterns (IF/HOWEVER) often represent splits—conditions that pull in different directions. Recognizing where a situation naturally divides enables clean separation rather than messy tearing. Coordination has cost precisely because it couples things that might split.	li, split, eight, gates, lie, tensions, patterns, however, often, represent
eight-gates/lu-roll-back	telo	川	Lǚ: Roll Back -> telo/川: Risks (HOWEVER fields) are not obstacles to eliminate but forces to redirect. Acknowledging a risk means adhering to it—understanding its shape—not fighting it. The vacuum created by yielding destabilizes the source more than resistance would.	l, roll, back, eight, gates, lu, risks, however, fields, obstacles
eight-gates/peng-ward-off	insa	山	Péng: Ward Off -> insa/山: Péng is born from good rooting. Without grounding in scope conditions, there's nothing to expand from. The spring metaphor: compression stores energy that releases as expansion, transforming incoming force into outward presence.	p, ng, ward, off, eight, gates, peng, born, good, rooting
eight-gates/pluck-extract	kala	爪	Pluck: Extract Suspect Component -> kala/爪: Cǎi is a downward grounding energy that seizes and connects. In security terms: we don't destroy the whole pattern, we specifically identify and remove the contaminated component. This respects that patterns often fail in specific ways rather than globally. The grounding aspect means we stay connected to evidence — we extract what the tests identified, not what we suspect.	pluck, extract, suspect, component, eight, gates, c, i, downward, grounding
eight-gates/press-mechanism	lukin	力	Press: Demand Mechanism Test -> lukin/力: Jǐ focuses energy on a single point. In security terms: we don't attack the whole pattern, we scrutinize the warrant. A decorative BECAUSE can justify any THEN equally well — it's post-hoc rationalization that sounds explanatory but carries no discriminative power. A genuine BECAUSE constrains which THEN clauses follow — it has causal teeth.	press, demand, mechanism, test, eight, gates, j, focuses, energy, single
eight-gates/push-warrant	utala	正	Push: Force Warrant Test -> utala/正: Àn applies sustained structural pressure. In security terms: we don't accept "it works" as sufficient. We require "it's appropriate to adopt given our goals, constraints, and the externalities involved." A pattern can work perfectly while being the wrong choice. Warrant bridges mechanism and appropriateness.	push, force, warrant, test, eight, gates, n, applies, sustained, structural
eight-gates/roll-back-hold	telo	止	Roll Back: Hold Without Adopting -> telo/止: Lǚ yields and redirects incoming force rather than meeting it directly. In security terms: we acknowledge the pattern exists, we don't deny its claims, but we don't let it produce action. By adhering to the pattern's structure, we can study it. By redirecting its energy, we prevent harm while preserving information.	roll, back, hold, without, adopting, eight, gates, l, yields, redirects
eight-gates/split-isolate	kipisi	分	Split: Isolate Pattern from Context -> kipisi/分: Liè is a splitting energy that creates separation through opposing forces. In security terms: we're not destroying the pattern, we're separating it from the context in which it could do harm. This is different from extraction (Cǎi) which removes a component — splitting removes the pattern from the field entirely while keeping it intact for analysis.	split, isolate, pattern, context, eight, gates, li, splitting, energy, creates
eight-gates/ward-off-boundary	taso	山	Ward Off: Establish Boundary -> taso/山: Péng creates space by expanding from a rooted base. The rooting here is the tripwire signal — genuine evidence that something requires attention. Expansion is the boundary itself: structured presence that contains without crushing. This prevents both the harm of premature action AND the harm of lost information.	ward, off, establish, boundary, eight, gates, p, ng, creates, space
eight-gates/zhou-elbow	utala	力	Zhǒu: Elbow -> utala/力: Some patterns apply at close range—when you're already in the middle of execution, when there's no time to step back and reassess. The center (core values, grounded scope) still governs even rapid close-range action.	zh, u, elbow, eight, gates, zhou, some, patterns, apply, close
exotic/construction-discipline	kepeken	示	Construction Discipline for Law Checking -> kepeken/示: Construction discipline provides runtime safety without per-operation overhead (validate once, trust thereafter). Property tests provide confidence in the constructors themselves. Test logs contribute to exotic scoring (regimes that pass more tests are healthier).	construction, discipline, law, checking, exotic, provides, runtime, safety, without, per
exotic/dual-track-generation	tu	二	Dual-Track Generated Patterns -> tu/二: This creates a clear path from generation to canonization while preserving the audit trail. Draft namespaces prevent accidental use of unreviewed patterns. Archive preserves learning even from rejected ideas.	dual, track, generated, patterns, exotic, generation, creates, clear, path, canonization
exotic/dual-windowing	ale	乃	Dual Windowing -> ale/乃: This allows iterative development (test the ratchet quickly with primary windows) while building toward the interpretable goal (mission-aligned windows for exotic scoring).	dual, windowing, exotic, allows, iterative, development, test, ratchet, quickly, primary

liberation/mundane/right-action	utala	世	Mundane Right Action: Refraining from Killing, Stealing, Sexual Misconduct -> utala/世: Mundane right action creates conditions for safety, trust, and respect. But one can refrain from wrong action while still attached to being a "good person" or to the social status that moral conduct confers. This is better than wrong action but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, action, refraining, killing, stealing, sexual, misconduct, liberation, creates
liberation/mundane/right-concentration	tenpo	世	Mundane Right Concentration: The Four Jhanas -> tenpo/世: Mundane right concentration creates conditions for clear seeing — the stable, unified mind can investigate experience without being swept away. But one can attain jhana while still attached to the states themselves, to being a "jhana attainer," to the bliss and refinement. This is better than wrong concentration but not yet liberation — it leads to rebirth in Brahma realms, not to nibbana.	mundane, right, concentration, four, jhanas, liberation, creates, conditions, clear, seeing
liberation/mundane/right-effort	pali	世	Mundane Right Effort: The Four Great Strivings -> pali/世: Mundane right effort creates conditions for mental transformation — without effort, change doesn't happen.

liberation/mundane/right-intention	jelo	世	Mundane Right Intention: Renunciation, Good Will, Harmlessness -> jelo/世: Mundane right intention is not wrong — it genuinely redirects mental activity away from harmful patterns.

This is better than wrong intention but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, intention, renunciation, good, harmlessness, liberation, wrong, genuinely, redirects
liberation/mundane/right-livelihood	mani	世	Mundane Right Livelihood: Giving Up Wrong Livelihood -> mani/世: Mundane right livelihood creates conditions for ethical life — if your living depends on harm, every day deepens complicity.

This is better than wrong livelihood but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, livelihood, giving, up, wrong, liberation, creates, conditions, ethical
liberation/mundane/right-mindfulness	oko	世	Mundane Right Mindfulness: The Four Foundations -> oko/世: Mundane right mindfulness creates conditions for seeing clearly — without awareness of what's happening, wisdom has no material to work with.

This is better than wrong mindfulness but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, mindfulness, four, foundations, liberation, creates, conditions, seeing, clearly
liberation/mundane/right-speech	toki	世	Mundane Right Speech: Refraining from False, Divisive, Harsh, Idle Talk -> toki/世: Mundane right speech creates conditions for trust and clear communication.

This is better than wrong speech but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, speech, refraining, false, divisive, harsh, idle, talk, liberation
liberation/mundane/right-view	lukin	世	Mundane Right View: Provisional Explanatory Frames -> lukin/世: Mundane right view is not wrong — it is incomplete.

This is better than wrong view but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, view, provisional, explanatory, frames, liberation, wrong, incomplete, partakes
liberation/noble/right-action	utala	天	Noble Right Action: The Abstaining Faculty Itself -> utala/天: The body acts constantly, but the quality of action differs when it flows from path rather than from craving.

liberation/noble/right-concentration	tenpo	天	Noble Right Concentration: Immersion with Vital Conditions -> tenpo/天: "Right view comes first." From right view → right intention → right speech → right action → right livelihood → right effort → right mindfulness → right immersion → right knowledge → right freedom. The path is linear AND circular: each factor supports the others.	noble, right, concentration, immersion, vital, conditions, liberation, view, comes, first
liberation/noble/right-effort	pali	天	Noble Right Effort: The Striving Faculty Itself -> pali/天: Right effort runs and circles around all the other factors — it is what makes the difference between understanding and doing, between knowing and practicing. Noble right effort is this energetic commitment functioning without an exhaustible efforter.	noble, right, effort, striving, faculty, itself, liberation, runs, circles, around
liberation/noble/right-intention	jelo	天	Noble Right Intention: The Thinking Faculty Itself -> jelo/天: Vitakka (thinking, placing) is wider than discursive thought. In deep practice it becomes the directional quality of mind itself — where attention goes, how engagement unfolds. Noble right intention is this directional capacity undefiled.	noble, right, intention, thinking, faculty, itself, liberation, vitakka, placing, wider
liberation/noble/right-livelihood	mani	天	Noble Right Livelihood: The Abstaining Faculty Itself -> mani/天: Livelihood is the most sustained form of action — it shapes daily life hour by hour. When this sustained pattern becomes transparent to path-factors, everyday activity becomes practice.	noble, right, livelihood, abstaining, faculty, itself, liberation, most, sustained, form
liberation/noble/right-mindfulness	oko	天	Noble Right Mindfulness: The Mindfulness Faculty Itself -> oko/天: Right mindfulness runs and circles around all the other factors — it is what allows each factor to be practiced with clarity rather than blindly. Noble right mindfulness is this monitoring awareness functioning without a monitor separate from the awareness.	noble, right, mindfulness, faculty, itself, liberation, runs, circles, around, all
liberation/noble/right-speech	toki	天	Noble Right Speech: The Abstaining Faculty Itself -> toki/天: The synonyms pile up (ārati, virati, paṭivirati, veramaṇī) to indicate the faculty from multiple angles, not the act of any actor. This is the verbal-conduct-shaping capacity operating without defilement.	noble, right, speech, abstaining, faculty, itself, liberation, synonyms, pile, up
liberation/noble/right-view	lukin	天	Noble Right View: The Wisdom Faculty Itself -> lukin/天: Content can always be grasped. What cannot be grasped is the seeing itself. Noble right view is the seeing, not the seen — the capacity to distinguish, not the distinction held.	noble, right, view, wisdom, faculty, itself, liberation, content, always, grasped
library-coherence/library-embedding-refresh	sin	归	Sigil Embedding Refresh Ritual -> sin/归: similarity results only earn trust when the embedding reflects the latest canon—otherwise Prototype 2 devolves into hand-waving	sigil, embedding, refresh, ritual, library, coherence, similarity, results, only, earn
library-coherence/library-evidence-ledger	kin	了	Canon Evidence Ledger -> kin/了: a canon without an evidence ledger collapses into lore—dhammavicaya demands that every “ready” claim is backed by published artifacts	canon, evidence, ledger, library, coherence, without, collapses, lore, dhammavicaya, demands

library-coherence/library-staleness-scan	wile	习	Canon Staleness Scan -> wile/习: library coherence depends on time—not just content—staying aligned; a regular staleness scan keeps the canon trustworthy for downstream futons	canon, staleness, scan, library, coherence, depends, time, just, content, staying
library-coherence/library-template-discipline	wile	世	Canon Template Discipline -> wile/世: the canon only works when patterns stay machine-readable—template drift makes the check DSL brittle and the README evidence unverifiable	canon, template, discipline, library, coherence, only, works, when, patterns, stay
library-coherence/pattern-differentiation-alarms	kute	习	Pattern Differentiation Alarms -> kute/习: sigils are coordinates in the fake embedding—when they collapse, it signals our pattern library is too coarse for dhammavicaya to stay honest	pattern, differentiation, alarms, library, coherence, sigils, coordinates, fake, embedding, when
meta/designing-thoughts-not-text	kasi	甲	Designing Thoughts, Not Text -> kasi/甲: Thought patterns stay modular and auditable; prose becomes a thin rendering that cannot drift away from the design intent.	designing, thoughts, text, meta, thought, patterns, stay, modular, auditable, prose
meta/layering-design-into-argument	sina	以	Layering Design Into Argument -> sina/以: When prose is downstream of patterns, the argument inherits their clarity and the canon can detect overclaiming.	layering, design, argument, meta, when, prose, downstream, patterns, inherits, clarity
meta/scaffolding-emergent-clarity	tomo	门	Scaffolding Emergent Clarity -> tomo/门: Patterns compress thought into precise, reusable units; recursive use turns undifferentiated conversation into structured design language while keeping this meta-work distinct from downstream funding or delivery governance.	scaffolding, emergent, clarity, meta, patterns, compress, thought, precise, reusable, units
meta/sigil-differentiation	kute	归	Sigil Differentiation Protocol -> kute/归: Sigils are coordinates; when they overlap, dhammavicaya can’t distinguish patterns, so we must either move the coordinate or reshape the terrain.	sigil, differentiation, protocol, meta, sigils, coordinates, when, overlap, dhammavicaya, t

Treating them as lived crossroads stabilises attention and makes insight and resilience more available.	embodied, reasoning, wellbeing, mojo, south, choices, set, conditions, under, which
mojo/up	ni	云	Co-Readiness -> ni/云: Futures take shape in fields where mutual capacity and tempo are respected. Co-readiness grows when people can adjust to one another’s rhythms rather than being dragged by them.	co, readiness, mojo, up, futures, take, shape, fields, where, mutual
mojo/west	ante	也	Tune the Instrument -> ante/也: Tuning is a form of creative renewal. By treating routines as something you can re-create, you allow life to be periodically recomposed so that it better supports and refreshes you.	tune, instrument, mojo, west, tuning, form, creative, renewal, treating, routines

Related precedents include initiatives such as realtalk@MIT, PlanetMath.org, and Peeragogy.	executive, summary, t4r, exec, tree, most, doctoral, programmes, operate, within
t4r/legacy	pali	了	5 Legacy and sustainability -> pali/了: The programme yields software components, data schemas, and design templates alongside researchers fluent in listening, analysis, and redesign. Each doctoral project produces a self-contained yet interoperable prototype, so sustainability never depends on a single host institution. The Supplement embodies this ethos as a collaboratively authored artefact that is simultaneously document, dataset, and performance. Graduates seed the method elsewhere while the open infrastructure supports new nodes linking universities, civic organisations, and cultural institutions into an evolving ecosystem.	5, legacy, sustainability, t4r, programme, yields, software, components, data, schemas
t4r/rationale	pali	了	1 Rationale for the choice of research subject area -> pali/了: Research policies, tools, and incentives currently pile up without coherent mechanisms for reflection. Institutions generate knowledge faster than they can interpret, while prevailing audits and surveys prioritise compliance over learning. The Supplement’s simulated dialogue, participatory annotation, and iterative synthesis show the research system studying itself in real time. Formalising a social-psychological REPL makes reflexive learning habitual from doctoral study to institutional governance.	1, rationale, choice, research, subject, area, t4r, policies, tools, incentives
t4r/supplement	pali	了	Supplement workshop transcript -> pali/了: Facilitators run five segments mapped to Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop with defined roles—facilitator, recorder, reporter, persona agents—to interrogate the brief. Persona statements from researchers, doctoral scholars, developer-scholars, supervisors, administrators, and the talk4real team surface strengths, blind spots, and initial stances. Participants co-design minimal listening captures, consent protocols, tagging vocabularies, and assessment artefacts that treat stories as analyzable yet textured data. Live debate over anonymisation, governance boards, licensing, and preserving dissent keeps the Print phase accountable to what Read reveals, demonstrating the reflexive loop in action.	supplement, workshop, transcript, t4r, facilitators, run, five, segments, mapped, read
t4r/support	pata	女	6 Additional financial or other support resources -> pata/女: The main assets are conversation, computation, and coordination already present in partner institutions, so core costs focus on stipends, workshops, and hosting. Partners such as the UK Reproducibility Network, PathOS, and the Oxford Schwartzman Centre plus allied studios and labs contribute mentoring and in-kind expertise. Open-source software, shared cloud infrastructure, and cross-university collaboration keep financial overhead minimal while maximising reach. Outputs remain freely available, ensuring continuing value beyond the funding window.	6, additional, financial, other, support, resources, t4r, main, assets, conversation
t4r/training	poka	友	4 Supervision, training, and cohort-building activities -> poka/友: Supervision is collaborative and polyphonic, pairing disciplinary mentors with methodological companions in ethnography, data science, and design. Training follows the shared REPL rhythm demonstrated in the Supplement, grounding every project in a common protocol. Cohort practices such as listening clinics and signal-boost workshops share data, analyse overlaps, and co-design interventions. Portfolio assessment with open datasets, code notebooks, design artefacts, and open peer review makes each scholar a co-investigator refining the collective infrastructure.	4, supervision, training, cohort, building, activities, t4r, collaborative, polyphonic, pairing
t4r/value	jelo	以	3 Added value to the field and the universities -> jelo/以: Ten linked doctoral projects—talk4maths, talk4health, talk4policy, talk4arts, and others—test the same REPL architecture in different domains. Each project contributes stories, datasets, and tools to an evolving commons that lets institutions reflect collectively. The Supplement demonstrates cross-voice dialogue, thematic tagging, consent protocols, and reflective synthesis working as a live prototype. Universities gain a practical method for adaptive governance, and the wider field gains a way to study and iteratively improve epistemic systems.	3, added, value, field, universities, t4r, ten, linked, doctoral, projects

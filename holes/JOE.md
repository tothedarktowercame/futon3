# Current Proof Obligations (23 Nov 2025)

Derived via FUTON0 ↔ PARAMITA1 convolution per `AGENTS.md`.

## Immediate priorities:

  1. Put the repo under git (private if needed) so future ledger updates and PARAMITA logs can be diffed easily.
  2. Draft initial devmaps for FUTON3/5/6/7 so the stack coverage goal can clear.
  3. Log a tai-chi/exercise session, a Penmaster recording, and a FUTON1-tagged work session to close Prototype 0
     items.
  4. Run the weekly AOB/Ambitions sync + WIP audit and note any Org↔FUTON syncs to satisfy Prototype 1.
  5. Capture a tangible job-performance win and one job-search action for Prototype 2/7, and add a short architecture
     note (Org entry) to tick the Prototype 5 box.
  6. Start archiving JOE.md weekly (e.g., JOE-2025w47.md) as you begin PARAMITA‑2 and beyond.

Mark each checkbox once evidence is recorded (PARAMITA entry, Org log, FUTON trace). This list covers the unmet clauses identified in the last tactic-state convolution.

## Prototype 0 — System Vitality Indicators
- [ ] 🧘 / 弓 (Tai chi): schedule or log 1–2 sessions this week.
- [ ] 🏃 / 卫 (Exercise guard): raise exercise evidence from “low (1)” to at least “moderate” by logging one concrete session.
- [ ] 🎙️ / 子 (Penmaster cadence): record one short Penmaster entry (counts toward the 170 target).
- [ ] 🗒️ / 工 (Work-session logs): explicitly tag a FUTON1 session + monthly pattern note.

## Prototype 1 — Epistemic Rhythm & Salients
- [ ] 📅 / 上 (Weekly sync): run and log the AOB/Ambitions check-in.
- [ ] ⚖️ / 义 (WIP audit): confirm ≤3 focus tracks and note the check.
- [ ] 🗂️ / 云 (Org↔FUTON sync): document data/dashboard adjustments.

## Prototype 2 — Core Obligations Contract
- [ ] 🛠️ / 工 (Job performance): capture a concrete win/deliverable from the current role.
- [ ] 🎯 / 历 (Job search cadence): document one outreach/application/prep action.
- [ ] 🏃 / 卫 (Exercise baseline): overlaps with Prototype 0.

## Prototype 3 — Ambition 0 Infrastructure
- [ ] 🗂️ / 上 (Org↔FUTON↔backup sync).
- [ ] 📊 / 云 (Dashboard pruning note).

## Prototype 5 — FUTON–Arxana Stack Stewardship
- [ ] 💾 / 工 (FUTON1 daily test log).
- [ ] 📝 / 己 (Architecture note / reflection).

## Prototype 6 — Mojo + Reflective Rhythm
- [ ] 🤝 / 女 (Coaching/mentoring touchpoint).
- [ ] 🃏 / 己 (Card/pattern journaling reference).

## Prototype 7 — Role Transition Trajectory
- [ ] 🎯 / 历 (Job-search outreach or interview prep).
- [ ] 🧾 / 口 (Recommendation material status update).

## Prototype 8 — Stack Coverage Check
- [ ] 📚 / 门 (Audit futon1–futon7 devmaps; log TODOs for missing FUTON3/5/6/7 and start authoring).

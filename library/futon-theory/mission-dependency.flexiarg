+ CONTEXT:
    Missions rarely exist in isolation. They block and enable each other,
    share prerequisites, and compete for resources. Without explicit
    dependency tracking, agents work on blocked missions or miss
    opportunities to unblock others.

+ IF:
    You are planning work across multiple missions or diagnosing why
    a mission is stuck.

+ HOWEVER:
    Dependencies can be circular (requiring negotiation), soft (preferred
    but not required), or discovered late. The graph must be maintainable.

+ THEN:
    Model missions as a directed acyclic graph (DAG):

    RELATIONSHIP-TYPES:
    - blocks: Mission A must complete before Mission B can start
    - enables: Mission A completion makes Mission B easier (soft)
    - shares: Missions A and B share a resource or decision
    - parent-child: Mission A spawned Mission B (split)

    REPRESENTATION:
    In mission docs:
    ```
    Blocked-by: M-other-mission.md
    Enables: M-downstream.md
    ```

    CONSTRAINTS:
    - No orphan missions (every mission linked to at least one other or to root)
    - No cycles in "blocks" relationships
    - Blocked missions must cite specific blocker
    - When blocker completes, blocked mission notified

    PRIORITY-INFERENCE:
    - Missions that unblock many others have higher priority
    - Leaf missions (no blockers) can proceed immediately
    - Root missions (no dependents) may be deprioritized

+ BECAUSE:
    - Explicit dependencies prevent wasted work on blocked missions
    - Graph structure enables priority inference
    - Unblock propagation accelerates overall progress
    - Shared resources surface coordination needs

+ VISUALIZATION:
    The mission graph can be rendered:
    ```
    M-futon1a-rebuild
        ├── blocks → M-futon1a-migration
        └── enables → M-pattern-inference-engine

    M-make-agency-work-properly
        └── blocks → M-codex-parity
    ```

+ NEXT-STEPS:
    - Audit mission docs for dependency declarations
    - Build mission graph from declarations
    - Identify leaf missions (unblocked, can work now)
    - Identify high-value unblock targets

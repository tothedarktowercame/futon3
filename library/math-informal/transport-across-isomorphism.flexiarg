! conclusion:
  Prove something in one setting, then transport the result to an isomorphic setting for free.

  + context: You need to prove a property of an object X, and there is an isomorphic object Y
    where the property is already known or easier to establish.
  + IF:
      X and Y are connected by an isomorphism (or equivalence) in the relevant category, and
      the property you care about is invariant under isomorphism.

  + HOWEVER:
      You must verify that the property is indeed isomorphism-invariant. Not all properties
      transfer: a specific element, an embedding into a particular ambient space, or a
      computational representation may not survive transport.

  + THEN:
      Establish the isomorphism between X and Y. Prove the property for whichever side is
      easier. Invoke isomorphism-invariance to conclude for the other side. For structured
      settings, use the naturality of the isomorphism.

  + BECAUSE:
      "Isomorphic objects are the same for all mathematical purposes" is the fundamental
      principle of abstract mathematics. Transport lets you work in whichever representation
      is most convenient.

    next[Establish the isomorphism or equivalence.]
    next[Verify the property is invariant under it.]
    next[Prove in the easier setting and transport.]

! conclusion: A good pattern states the causal chain that links context to the proposed action and expected outcome.
  + context: Patterns are accepted as “nice ideas” but fail when applied because the cause-and-effect path is implicit.
  + IF:
    The solution seems reasonable but the mechanism is not stated or testable.
  + HOWEVER:
    Some domains rely on tacit practice and the mechanism may be partially inferred.
  + THEN:
    Write the causal steps explicitly: what condition triggers the action, what changes, and why that change yields the outcome.
    Include a short counterfactual (“If we did X instead, we would likely see Y”) to show why the action matters.
  + BECAUSE:
    Patterns are decisions under uncertainty; an explicit mechanism makes them inspectable and improvable.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - evidence: a concrete example where the stated mechanism predicts the outcome.
    - evidence: a counterexample where the mechanism fails and the pattern should not be used.
    - evidence-shape: {:context :string, :trigger :string, :action :string, :mechanism :string, :expected/outcome :string, :counterfactual :string}

! conclusion:
  Understand that the six-month window is feasible because the pilot confines
  itself to a small sample of proofs, iterative annotation, seminar evaluation,
  and reporting—leaving storage/UI/inference to other futons.

  + context: You are showing the pilot timeline and resourcing are feasible.

  + if:
    Repository-transition invariants and stack-blocker detection already keep us
    honest about what infrastructure exists.

  + however:
    Without explicit scope fences, AI4CI could drift into trying to build
    long-term storage or UI layers, blowing the schedule.

  + then:
    Freeze scope to: data selection, dual-language annotation, MUSN logging,
    seminars, and report-out.  Track each clause with `next[...]` so blockers are
    visible.

  + because:
    Dhammavicaya demands evidence of progress toward “done”; the pilot only
    needs methodological answers, not production modules.

  + status:

  + next-steps:
    next[Map the proof sample + annotation sprints to a Gantt-lite timeline and publish it in the devmap.]
    next[Record blockers/clears weekly so stack-coherence patterns can prove the pilot stayed inside scope.]

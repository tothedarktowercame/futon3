! conclusion:
  The symbolic geodesic is the shortest defensible path in symbolic state
  space - the minimal proof path from intent to verified claim. It is not
  about speed but about eliminating unnecessary complexity.

  + context: In differential geometry, a geodesic is the shortest path between
    two points on a curved surface. In futon theory, the symbolic geodesic is
    the minimal sequence of operations that moves from intent to verified
    outcome while maintaining auditability.

  + DEFINITION:
    A symbolic geodesic is a proof path that:
    1. Starts from a well-defined intent
    2. Proceeds through minimal required operations
    3. Ends at a verified claim with durable proof
    4. Contains no redundant steps
    5. Remains fully auditable throughout

  + PROPERTIES:
    - Minimal: No operation can be removed without breaking the proof
    - Direct: Each step advances toward the goal
    - Defensible: Every step has explicit justification
    - Verifiable: The path can be replayed and checked

  + GEODESIC-VS-ACTUAL:
    Real sessions may deviate from the geodesic (exploration, false starts).
    The geodesic is the retrospective "ideal path" that could have achieved
    the same outcome with minimal steps. Session logs capture actual paths;
    analysis can extract geodesics for learning.

  + APPLICATION:
    - Pattern selection: Choose patterns that shorten the geodesic
    - Refactoring: Identify steps that can be eliminated
    - Learning: Compare actual paths to geodesics for prediction improvement
    - Review: Is this the shortest defensible path, or are there detours?

  + RELATIONSHIP-TO-CURRY-HOWARD:
    Programs are proofs of their specifications. The geodesic is the most
    elegant proof - the one a mathematician would publish. Longer proofs
    work, but the geodesic demonstrates mastery.

  + BECAUSE:
    Complexity is cost. Every step in a proof path is a potential failure
    point, a debugging surface, a thing to maintain. The geodesic minimizes
    this surface while maintaining defensibility.

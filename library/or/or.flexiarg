! conclusion: License Laddering [🔺/工 📐/正]
  + context: Licensing confusion paralyses Open Research teams; drafts stall while contributors fear being “too open” or “not open enough.”
  + if: You aim for maximal remixability while preserving dignity and traceable attribution.
  + however: Legal anxiety and moral caution pull toward NC/ND restrictions that persist long after their original justification.
  + then: Begin from a permissive default (e.g., CC BY) and step downward only when a written, reviewable harm model requires it. Assign each restriction a steward, rationale, and review date. Publish a short License Story beside each licence.
  + because: Evidence from OSS/OER shows permissive licences increase remix, translation, and classroom adoption. Harm models turn vague fear into auditable, time-limited clarity.
  + next-steps:
      - Add a Licence Story to this catalogue as a live exemplar.
      - Create one contrasting case where restrictive terms are justified.
      - Link to an “Open Commercialisation” draft pattern for value-capture questions.
  + governance:
      - practice: include licence review in quarterly Tune Audits (“Does this story still ring true?”).
      - metric: visible commit history updating rationale, steward, or licence level.

! conclusion: License-as-Story [🎎/口 👄/文]
  + context: Standard licence boilerplate rarely communicates intent; badges look official but feel sterile, and newcomers cannot tell how to use work responsibly.
  + if: You want reciprocity and lineage, not just formal compliance, and you see licensing as a chance to express relationship, not only ownership.
  + however: Legal phrasing alienates non-specialists; people skim the code, miss the ethos, and maintainers end up policing misunderstandings.
  + then: Pair every legal licence with a short, human-readable License Story: “We chose X because… Please do… Please avoid… If unsure…” Optionally record a 60-second audio version spoken by a steward.
  + because: Narrative licence notes improve contributor understanding, reduce misuse, and spark richer conversations about attribution and reciprocity. The story turns licensing into a living social contract.
  + next-steps:
      - Record an audio Licence Story for this catalogue.
      - Curate three exemplars (data, code, OER) using this format.
      - Add guidance for awkward cases (mixed authorship, dual licences).
  + governance:
      - practice: sample one Licence Story per repo during Tune Audits for tone and clarity.
      - metric: new contributors correctly reuse and attribute assets without seeking extra permission.

! conclusion: Platform Choreography [🎶/人 🚴/心]
  + context: Open projects accumulate tools — GitHub, drives, Slack, Overleaf, wikis — each with its own rhythm. Notifications multiply; attention fragments; contributors burn out from noise rather than conflict.
  + if: You want predictable collaboration rhythms and treat attention as a shared resource to be guarded, not consumed.
  + however: Tools are added opportunistically; chats interrupt deep work; issue trackers overflow; volunteers lose track of when and where to contribute.
  + then: Treat the ecosystem as a dance, not a stack. Map tempos of each channel (daily, weekly, monthly), cap alerts per person, keep one slow “sketch” space and one fast coordination lane, and publish a Dance Card that shows when commits, triage, and reviews happen.
  + because: Predictable cadences correlate with contributor retention, fewer orphan branches, and clearer trust. Rhythm becomes a governance instrument instead of background noise.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish a Dance Card for this catalogue’s edit and release cycles.
      - Compare metrics (merge rate, retention) before and after cadence changes.
      - Share a choreography map overlaying platforms, tempos, and roles.
  + governance:

! conclusion: Friction-as-Feature [🔥/石 〰️/反]
  + context: Integration efforts often aim to erase seams via automation and unification; but seamlessness can hide translation work and dilute accountability.
  + if: You need interoperability that preserves meaning differences, provenance, and stewardship across systems.
  + however: Cultural and managerial pressure prizes smooth dashboards and invisible handoffs; when errors appear, no one can see where translation went wrong.
  + then: Treat seams as features, not flaws. Name and document each seam (e.g., metadata crosswalks), maintain a Seam Registry with steward, cadence, rationale, and “what we’d lose if smoothed,” and hold brief Seam Debates to revisit design choices.
  + because: Constructive friction clarifies ownership, reduces schema drift, and fosters cross-team understanding. Visible seams are repairable edges rather than brittle failure points.
  + next-steps:
      - Create a public Seam Registry for this catalogue’s pipelines.
      - Document one over-smoothed failure and one seam-preserving success.
      - Publish a 15-minute Seam Debate format with guiding questions.
  + governance:

! conclusion: Bridge-Before-Portal [🌲/门 🚢/川]
  + context: Faced with fragmented systems, teams dream of one portal that unifies access; portal projects become expensive, slow, and prone to lock-in.
  + if: You seek interoperability and shared visibility quickly while preserving flexibility for future architectures.
  + however: Institutional incentives reward big launches over modest connectors; monolithic portals over-specify needs, become brittle, and exhaust teams.
  + then: Start with bridges rather than portals: small, reversible connections such as exports, DOI cross-links, citation recipes, or shared notebooks. Each bridge must pass a reversal test: can you reconstruct your data or process if the bridge disappears?
  + because: Bridges enable staged federation and mutual learning without committing to one architecture. They preserve optionality, lower risk, and turn integrations into negotiable boundary objects.
  + next-steps:
      - Implement a simple bridge between this catalogue and another pattern repository.
      - Create a reversal-test checklist and apply it to existing integrations.
      - Document one failed portal attempt and what a bridge-first approach would have changed.
  + governance:

! conclusion: Snapshot-with-Story DOI [📥/文 📤/示]
  + context: Repositories routinely mint DOIs, but deposits often feel opaque; readers see version numbers without understanding intent or trajectory.
  + if: You want releases to be both citable and alive, linking frozen artefacts to ongoing work.
  + however: Deposit workflows optimise for compliance, not communication; metadata is perfunctory, and DOIs become cold identifiers rather than narrative anchors.
  + then: Pair every DOI with a Release Story (~120 words) explaining what changed, what remains open, and how to cite. Each release bundles (a) immutable archive, (b) STORY.md, (c) link to the active workspace or repo.
  + because: Narrative DOIs see more accurate citation, fewer misuse tickets, and clearer reuse; they transform preservation into pedagogy by contextualising the snapshot.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish this pattern’s own Release Story and link it to its DOI.
      - Curate examples of good Release Stories for data, code, and preprints.
      - Add a CI hook to require STORY.md for each tagged release.

! conclusion: Identifier Garden [🌳/田 🐞/友]
  + context: Research ecosystems are dense with identifiers (DOI, ORCID, ROR, grant IDs); unmanaged, they become confusing “ID sprawl.”
  + if: You value provenance, credit, and discoverability and want identifiers to enhance human understanding rather than burden it.
  + however: When IDs multiply without stewardship, they become bureaucratic weeds: outdated records, broken provenance, mismatched dashboards, and wasted reconciliation effort.
  + then: Curate identifiers as a garden. Publish an ID Map listing each identifier type, what it represents, who stewards it, and when it was issued or verified. Adopt a minimal set per project and prune regularly.
  + because: Explicit ID policies prevent drift, reduce maintenance overhead, and improve automated linking across DOI–ORCID–ROR triples. The garden metaphor frames IDs as living elements needing care.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish an Identifier Garden for this catalogue, with stewards and review dates.
      - Build a simple Garden Check script to flag missing or stale IDs.
      - Share a Garden Companion snippet for READMEs and metadata headers.
  + governance:
      - practice: review the ID Map during readiness windows for correctness and minimality.

! conclusion: Two-Stage Fidelity (Registered Rhythm) [⌛️/土 ✊/义]
  + context: Protocols inevitably evolve; without visibility, analytic flexibility becomes invisible bias and HARKing.
  + if: You want both transparency and creativity, preserving a clear record of intention while allowing adaptive learning.
  + however: Preregistration is often treated as bureaucracy; deviations are hidden, and rigid templates discourage exploration.
  + then: Use a two-stage rhythm. Stage-1 preregisters design, anticipated challenges, and threat models. Stage-2 publishes results plus an adherence audit using a Deviation Ledger that records justified changes as first-class data.
  + because: Registered Reports show that preregistration reduces bias, and explicit deviation logs preserve interpretability. Together they balance rigour and discovery.
  + next-steps:
      - Preregister the next release of this catalogue and maintain a Deviation Ledger.
      - Share ledger examples from both qualitative and quantitative projects.
      - Draft an “Adaptive Protocols” companion pattern and link it here.
  + governance:
      - practice: include Deviation Ledger review in Tune Audits.

! conclusion: Method/Documentary Split [📁/书 ✂️/分]
  + context: In most projects, the protocol and the story collapse into a single document; methods are rewritten to match outcomes, hiding uncertainty and adaptation.
  + if: You value honesty, reproducibility, and institutional learning, and want future readers to see how discovery actually unfolded.
  + however: Fear of embarrassment or perceived loss of credibility leads teams to conceal deviations; journals reward polished linear narratives.
  + then: Publish two living artefacts: PROTOCOL.md (forward-looking intention and checks) and LOG.md (backward-looking account of what happened and what changed). Require both for releases and add a one-minute embodied reflection before signing off logs.
  + because: Separating plan from record normalises adaptation and preserves context. It accelerates troubleshooting, improves mentoring, and turns “failure” into documented learning.
  + next-steps:
      - Implement PROTOCOL.md and LOG.md for this catalogue.
      - Assemble a gallery of split examples from different domains.
      - Prototype a visual diff that overlays protocol and log changes.
  + governance:

! conclusion: Attribution-Forward Review [👥/文 💬/心]
  + context: Traditional anonymous peer review hides both power and care; reviewers feel disposable, authors feel judged by invisible forces.
  + if: You want review to function as dialogue and mentorship, not merely gatekeeping.
  + however: Reviewers fear retaliation or reputational harm; editors worry openness will reduce reviewer supply.
  + then: Shift to attribution-forward models where reviews are named by default (with consensual pseudonymity as an option) and each includes a stance note on expertise, conflicts, and values. Allow reviews to be citable artefacts in their own right.
  + because: Open review pilots show higher civility, specificity, and reusability; stance notes help readers contextualise critique. Attribution turns review into a shared scholarly contribution.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish one named review of this catalogue with stance notes.
      - Share a stance-note mini-form as a reusable template.
      - Compare outcomes from open vs. blind review in one venue and summarise.

! conclusion: Overlay Bridges [🚢/门 🌈/互]
  + context: Academic publishing remains dominated by legacy journals even as Open Research grows; authors still need career-legible outputs.
  + if: You want more open practices without severing links to recognised venues.
  + however: “Open-only” reforms can trigger resistance and duplicate labour; authors fear outcomes that “do not count.”
  + then: Build overlay bridges that route manuscripts through open, community-based review while retaining compatibility with target journals. Publish timelines and handoff packets (cover letter, review bundle) that show how reviews and revisions travel.
  + because: Overlay models shorten time-to-feedback, reuse reviewer effort, and preserve promotion-relevant outputs. They demonstrate coexistence rather than rupture between open and traditional systems.
  + next-steps:
      - Pilot an overlay handoff for this catalogue or a related paper.
      - Publish a generic Overlay SOP and handoff packet template.
      - Document one successful overlay and one failed attempt with lessons learned.

! conclusion: Peripheral-to-Core Pathways [🏃/入 👈/中]
  + context: Open communities often start with energetic newcomers at the margins, yet core roles ossify; newcomers circle indefinitely while veterans burn out.
  + if: You want growth through renewal, with newcomers becoming confident stewards and leaders over time.
  + however: Many groups equate “open” with “anyone can join,” without clear developmental routes; invisible hierarchies and extractive labour patterns persist.
  + then: Design explicit pathways: observe → co-do → steward. Each phase includes recognition (badges, micro-credentials), time-bound roles, and options to rotate out. Create a metaboliser process that turns complaints and conflicts into repair actions.
  + because: Transparent progression paths increase retention and distribute leadership more equitably; metabolising tensions into maintenance preserves trust.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish a Pathways Map for this catalogue’s contribution roles.
      - Host a metaboliser session using recent tensions and document outcomes.
      - Develop a badge rubric with sunset dates for stewardship roles.

! conclusion: Quality-by-Design Crowd [🎋/工 👀/正]
  + context: Crowdsourcing and citizen science rely on many contributors whose data quality varies widely; naive policing or rejection erodes trust.
  + if: You need reliable data while treating contributors as collaborators rather than expendable labour.
  + however: Without embedded structure, volunteers guess expectations, receive late feedback, and become discouraged when work is rejected.
  + then: Build quality into the workflow: use gold-standard screening questions, embed spot-checks and instant feedback, and publish fairness, wage, and recognition policies. Frame correction as coaching.
  + because: Embedded calibration improves accuracy and retention better than post-hoc filtering; transparent fairness norms increase commitment and reduce conflict.
  + next-steps:
      - Create a Screening Bank template with gold questions and answer keys.
      - Design feedback scripts or UI snippets for immediate, constructive responses.
      - Publish a quality dashboard spec (precision/recall, agreement, retention).

! conclusion: Citizen Co-Learning Track [👫/人 🚞/入]
  + context: Many crowdsourcing projects treat volunteers as task workers; once tasks end, engagement collapses and relationships dissolve.
  + if: You want participation that deepens over time, with volunteers becoming co-researchers who can interpret and shape future work.
  + however: Infrastructures are optimised for throughput, not growth; lessons and reflection spaces are afterthoughts, and churn is treated as inevitable.
  + then: Add a parallel co-learning track with short lessons tied to live project data, reflection prompts, and co-authorship opportunities. Maintain learning logs where participants narrate discoveries.
  + because: Structured learning increases retention, data quality, and trust. When contributors understand the science and see themselves as co-authors, motivation becomes stewardship.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish a learning track explaining how this catalogue evolves and inviting remix lessons.
      - Curate example projects with strong co-learning components and reference them.
      - Create a reusable reflection prompt bank for different phases of participation.

! conclusion: Five-P Rhythm for Impact [🎑/日 🔁/律]
  + context: Open Research meetings drift between chatter and overload; agendas swell, actions blur, and participants leave unsure what was achieved.
  + if: You want meetings that reliably generate both concrete outcomes and shared understanding.
  + however: Teams swing between hyper-productive checklists and unfocused discussion; without scaffolding, every meeting starts from scratch.
  + then: Use the Five-P rhythm: People (who’s here), Process (what’s working), Plan (what’s next), Product (deliverables), Perspective (what’s been learned). Close with a short After-Action Review and add a sentence to a public changelog.
  + because: Five-P balances efficiency with reflection; AARs and changelogs clarify accountability and make impact visible over time.
  + next-steps:
      - Run editorial meetings for this catalogue using Five-P and publish the changelog.
      - Produce a printable Five-P agenda/timer card.

! conclusion: Fit-for-Use Stars [🌝/用 💎/正]
  + context: The five-star open data ladder encourages continuous improvement but can paralyse teams who feel they must reach “perfect” before sharing.
  + if: You want data to be genuinely usable — shared early enough to matter, clear enough to trust, and structured enough for others to build on.
  + however: Pressure to hit high star levels delays deposit; ethics constraints and limited resources make full openness unrealistic.
  + then: Choose openness level by intended use rather than abstract ideal. Document it in a brief Use Note explaining trade-offs and planned upgrades. Treat openness as iterative design with scheduled enhancements.
  + because: Incremental sharing accelerates collaboration and preserves value; clear use-context prevents misinterpretation and sets realistic expectations for reuse.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish a Use Note for this catalogue’s data, with current star level and roadmap.

  + context: Continuous integration without temporal boundaries can become perpetual churn; major changes land at random, exhausting reviewers and users.
  + if: You value both responsiveness and reliability, aiming for deep innovation without undermining trust in shared infrastructure.
  + however: Uncoordinated change leads to version fatigue; people hesitate to build on unstable foundations, and governance becomes reactive firefighting.
  + then: Declare Readiness Windows — defined periods (e.g., quarterly) when schema-breaking or major changes are allowed. Outside windows, restrict changes to backward-compatible updates. Align audits, freezes, and celebrations with this schedule.
  + because: Temporal boundaries transform chaos into cadence. Predictable windows make change intentional, concentrate review effort, and create meaningful release moments.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish this catalogue’s change calendar with marked readiness windows.
      - Tag schema-affecting changes with their window in git history.
      - Design a “Window Badge” indicating last passed readiness review.

! conclusion: Tune Audits (Quarterly) [🎐/节 💬/公]
  + context: Libraries and frameworks accumulate noise over time; patterns that once sang drift out of tune, but maintenance focuses on bugs instead of meaning.
  + if: You want your project to remain alive and coherent, not merely operational.
  + however: Audits are often bureaucratic and postponed; “we’ll clean it up later” hides slow decay.
  + then: Hold quarterly Tune Audits. Randomly sample a small set of artefacts (e.g., three patterns) and ask, “Does this still sing?” Decide to renew, revise, or retire, and log short narrative notes rather than scores.
  + because: Lightweight, regular reflection keeps documentation aligned with practice. Tuning normalises revision and creates a public trail of living decisions.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish Tune Logs for this catalogue showing renew/revise/retire outcomes.
      - Experiment with simple rituals (audio snippets, icons) to mark tuned items.

  + then: Attach a short DREAM Audit to each release: a paragraph reflecting on Desire, Relationality, Embodiment, Autonomy, and Multiplicity since the last iteration. Publish these alongside technical notes.
  + because: DREAM audits keep the project’s inner compass visible, helping teams align ongoing work with founding purpose and relational health.
  + next-steps:
      - Add DREAM notes to the next release of this catalogue.
      - Invite individual contributors to contribute micro-audits and aggregate them.
      - Visualise DREAM themes over time as a simple trend or word map.
  + governance:
      - practice: check each tagged release for a DREAM note.
      - metric: releases read as letters from a living community rather than only change logs.

! conclusion: Maintainer Care [🙌/友 🍵/心]
  + context: Open projects depend on a few steady hands whose labour becomes invisible; burnout or departure can collapse continuity and tone.
  + if: You want sustainability grounded in care rather than heroism, recognising that bandwidth is finite.
  + however: Volunteer cultures often glorify self-sacrifice; metrics reward responsiveness, not rest, and burnout is individualised as “failure.”
  + then: Embed maintainer care into governance: quiet hours, rotating responsibilities, small stipends or micro-funds for caretaking work, and peer check-ins about energy. Treat maintainership as a shared rhythm, not a permanent identity.
  + because: Projects that foreground wellbeing retain maintainers longer and sustain clearer, kinder communication; care is infrastructural, not ornamental.
  + next-steps:
      - Publish a Maintainer Care Charter for this catalogue.
      - Document at least one care intervention and its observed effects.
      - Add a “Care Pulse” survey item to Tune Audits for maintainers.
  + governance:
      - practice: monitor response times, care-pulse responses, and rotation of demanding roles.
      - metric: maintainers self-report their work as sustainable and often energising.

! conclusion: Retirement Shelf [🍂/古 ➰/止]
  + context: Over time, projects accumulate legacy artefacts that no longer fit current realities; without rituals for letting go, clutter and confusion grow.
  + if: You want to honour lineage while keeping the system light enough to move.
  + however: Deletion feels disrespectful; founders resist archival moves; newcomers keep tripping over outdated guidance.
  + then: Create a Retirement Shelf — a visible archive for superseded patterns or components. For each item, publish a Retirement Note explaining why it was useful, why it is no longer active, and what replaces it. Mark retirements with simple ceremonies or reflections.
  + because: Dignified endings preserve institutional memory without clutter. Visible lineage supports transparency and helps newcomers understand evolution of practice.
  + next-steps:
      - Initialise a Retirement Shelf for this catalogue and migrate one pattern into it.
      - Record a short retirement reflection for that item.
      - Draw a lineage map linking retired artefacts to their successors.
  + governance:
      - practice: during Tune Audits, consider retire/replace as valid outcomes and move items accordingly.
      - metric: a slowly growing shelf with clear successors, signalling a culture that values endings as well as beginnings.

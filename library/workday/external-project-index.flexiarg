! conclusion: External Project Index as System of Record
  + context: The ChatGPT web sidebar is a slow, weak global navigator, and you are aiming to reduce dependence on the web UI. An external index can treat projects as contexts you can enter via stable pointers, while your own system becomes the canonical registry.
  + IF:
    You can identify a stable entry URL per project (for example, one canonical chat inside each project) and store it in a fast local registry.
  + HOWEVER:
    Some projects will not have a single obvious entry point, and links can become stale if you reorganize, rename, or delete chats.
  + THEN:
    Maintain a minimal registry that maps project-id or name to entry URL + short intent + last-touched date, and add a periodic link-audit micro-loop that refreshes broken pointers and promotes better entry chats when needed.
  + BECAUSE:
    A small, explicit registry decouples navigation from a slow UI surface and makes "where do I go next?" an inspectable, improvable artifact rather than an interaction with a sidebar.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Pick 10 high-use projects, create (or designate) one entry chat each, capture their URLs into a single file (or FUTON1 node set), and do a weekly audit for one month measuring time-to-open and percentage of stale links.]

This makes certain economic and coordination patterns visible that were previously implicit.	agential, open, source, infrastructure, control, oss, human, relies, tacit, learning, loops, code, review, norms, testing, practices, maintainer, judgment, acquired, through
control/agential-pattern-hygiene	telo	水	Agential Pattern Hygiene -> telo/水: Patterns can increase in quality through use and become living documents that reflect learned experience, rather than degrading into unmaintained dumping grounds.

corps/five-arrows-fit	pali	五	Relationship to existing doctoral training -> pali/五: The five transitions—student to colleague; apprentice to independent investigator; individual contributor to collaborative team member; private learner to public practitioner; project-focused worker to systems-aware researcher—already occur within doctoral pathways, but without a shared framework they are difficult to recognise, support, or evaluate. Making these transitions explicit helps align supervisory expectations with cohort development and with the institutional research culture that doctoral programmes aim to foster.	relationship, existing, doctoral, training, corps, five, arrows, fit, transitions, student, colleague, apprentice, independent, investigator, individual, contributor, collaborative, team, member, private
corps/letting-the-trace-teach	pana	文	Letting the Trace Teach (Private Learning → Public-Facing Identity) -> pana/文: Public-facing traces signal identity and invite collaboration; they provide low-risk entry points for others to understand, support, or extend the researcher’s work while helping the researcher build confidence as a contributor.	letting, trace, teach, private, learning, public, facing, identity, corps, traces, signal, invite, collaboration, provide, low, risk, entry, points, others, understand

corps/standing-in-the-circle	ona	仁	Standing in the Circle (Student → Colleague) -> ona/仁: Explicit reasoning creates recognition: supervisors and peers can respond at the appropriate level, collaboration becomes more mature, and the researcher internalises professional discourse norms that move them from student to colleague.	standing, circle, student, colleague, corps, explicit, reasoning, creates, recognition, supervisors, peers, respond, appropriate, level, collaboration, becomes, more, mature, researcher, internalises
corps/working-where-others-can-see	oko	示	Working Where Others Can See (Individual Contributor → Collaborative Team Member) -> oko/示: Collaboration relies on visible work surfaces.

devmap-coherence/baseline-freeze	walo	四	Baseline Freeze & Audit Hooks -> walo/四: dhammavicaya is about investigating what *already* exists; without explicit freezes and audit hooks, every promise of determinism becomes oral history	freeze, baseline, snapshot, audit, hook, verify, check, golden, reference, canonical, regression, hooks, devmap, coherence, dhammavicaya, investigating, what, already, exists, without

eight-gates/kao-lean	nena	山	Kào: Lean -> nena/山: Environment over optimization: sometimes you don't need a clever technique, you need to bring your whole context to bear. Handoff preserves context because it's structural—the trunk of accumulated state, not just the hands of immediate action.	k, o, lean, eight, gates, kao, environment, over, optimization, sometimes, don, t, need, clever, technique, bring, whole, context, bear, handoff
eight-gates/lean-commit	nena	山	Lean: Full Commitment Escalation -> nena/山: Kào uses the whole body's structure and weight. In security terms: when precision fails, structural response is needed. This is not a failure of the security layer — it's the correct response when a fabrication template has demonstrated resistance to lower escalation levels. The weight of Kào means the response is proportional to the confirmed threat.	lean, full, commitment, escalation, eight, gates, commit, k, o, uses, whole, body, s, structure, weight, security, terms, when, precision, fails
eight-gates/lie-split	kipisi	分	Liè: Split -> kipisi/分: Tensions in patterns (IF/HOWEVER) often represent splits—conditions that pull in different directions. Recognizing where a situation naturally divides enables clean separation rather than messy tearing. Coordination has cost precisely because it couples things that might split.	li, split, eight, gates, lie, tensions, patterns, however, often, represent, splits, conditions, pull, different, directions, recognizing, where, situation, naturally, divides
eight-gates/lu-roll-back	telo	川	Lǚ: Roll Back -> telo/川: Risks (HOWEVER fields) are not obstacles to eliminate but forces to redirect. Acknowledging a risk means adhering to it—understanding its shape—not fighting it. The vacuum created by yielding destabilizes the source more than resistance would.	l, roll, back, eight, gates, lu, risks, however, fields, obstacles, eliminate, forces, redirect, acknowledging, risk, means, adhering, understanding, its, shape
eight-gates/peng-ward-off	insa	山	Péng: Ward Off -> insa/山: Péng is born from good rooting. Without grounding in scope conditions, there's nothing to expand from. The spring metaphor: compression stores energy that releases as expansion, transforming incoming force into outward presence.	p, ng, ward, off, eight, gates, peng, born, good, rooting, without, grounding, scope, conditions, there, s, nothing, expand, spring, metaphor
eight-gates/pluck-extract	kala	爪	Pluck: Extract Suspect Component -> kala/爪: Cǎi is a downward grounding energy that seizes and connects. In security terms: we don't destroy the whole pattern, we specifically identify and remove the contaminated component. This respects that patterns often fail in specific ways rather than globally. The grounding aspect means we stay connected to evidence — we extract what the tests identified, not what we suspect.	pluck, extract, suspect, component, eight, gates, c, i, downward, grounding, energy, seizes, connects, security, terms, don, t, destroy, whole, pattern
eight-gates/press-mechanism	lukin	力	Press: Demand Mechanism Test -> lukin/力: Jǐ focuses energy on a single point. In security terms: we don't attack the whole pattern, we scrutinize the warrant. A decorative BECAUSE can justify any THEN equally well — it's post-hoc rationalization that sounds explanatory but carries no discriminative power. A genuine BECAUSE constrains which THEN clauses follow — it has causal teeth.	press, demand, mechanism, test, eight, gates, j, focuses, energy, single, point, security, terms, don, t, attack, whole, pattern, scrutinize, warrant
eight-gates/push-warrant	utala	正	Push: Force Warrant Test -> utala/正: Àn applies sustained structural pressure. In security terms: we don't accept "it works" as sufficient. We require "it's appropriate to adopt given our goals, constraints, and the externalities involved." A pattern can work perfectly while being the wrong choice. Warrant bridges mechanism and appropriateness.	push, force, warrant, test, eight, gates, n, applies, sustained, structural, pressure, security, terms, don, t, accept, works, sufficient, require, s
eight-gates/roll-back-hold	telo	止	Roll Back: Hold Without Adopting -> telo/止: Lǚ yields and redirects incoming force rather than meeting it directly. In security terms: we acknowledge the pattern exists, we don't deny its claims, but we don't let it produce action. By adhering to the pattern's structure, we can study it. By redirecting its energy, we prevent harm while preserving information.	roll, back, hold, without, adopting, eight, gates, l, yields, redirects, incoming, force, rather, than, meeting, directly, security, terms, acknowledge, pattern
eight-gates/split-isolate	kipisi	分	Split: Isolate Pattern from Context -> kipisi/分: Liè is a splitting energy that creates separation through opposing forces. In security terms: we're not destroying the pattern, we're separating it from the context in which it could do harm. This is different from extraction (Cǎi) which removes a component — splitting removes the pattern from the field entirely while keeping it intact for analysis.	split, isolate, pattern, context, eight, gates, li, splitting, energy, creates, separation, through, opposing, forces, security, terms, re, destroying, separating, which
eight-gates/ward-off-boundary	taso	山	Ward Off: Establish Boundary -> taso/山: Péng creates space by expanding from a rooted base. The rooting here is the tripwire signal — genuine evidence that something requires attention. Expansion is the boundary itself: structured presence that contains without crushing. This prevents both the harm of premature action AND the harm of lost information.	ward, off, establish, boundary, eight, gates, p, ng, creates, space, expanding, rooted, base, rooting, here, tripwire, signal, genuine, evidence, something
eight-gates/zhou-elbow	utala	力	Zhǒu: Elbow -> utala/力: Some patterns apply at close range—when you're already in the middle of execution, when there's no time to step back and reassess. The center (core values, grounded scope) still governs even rapid close-range action.	zh, u, elbow, eight, gates, zhou, some, patterns, apply, close, range, when, re, already, middle, execution, there, s, no, time
exotic/construction-discipline	kepeken	示	Construction Discipline for Law Checking -> kepeken/示: Construction discipline provides runtime safety without per-operation overhead (validate once, trust thereafter). Property tests provide confidence in the constructors themselves. Test logs contribute to exotic scoring (regimes that pass more tests are healthier).	construction, discipline, law, checking, exotic, provides, runtime, safety, without, per, operation, overhead, validate, once, trust, thereafter, property, tests, provide, confidence
exotic/dual-track-generation	tu	二	Dual-Track Generated Patterns -> tu/二: This creates a clear path from generation to canonization while preserving the audit trail. Draft namespaces prevent accidental use of unreviewed patterns. Archive preserves learning even from rejected ideas.	dual, track, generated, patterns, exotic, generation, creates, clear, path, canonization, while, preserving, audit, trail, draft, namespaces, prevent, accidental, use, unreviewed
exotic/dual-windowing	ale	乃	Dual Windowing -> ale/乃: This allows iterative development (test the ratchet quickly with primary windows) while building toward the interpretable goal (mission-aligned windows for exotic scoring).	dual, windowing, exotic, allows, iterative, development, test, ratchet, quickly, primary, windows, while, building, toward, interpretable, goal, mission, aligned, scoring, use
exotic/full-lift-registry	ale	入	Full Lift Registry with Lisp Templates -> ale/入: Lisp expressions are homoiconic (code as data), making templates manipulable by the same system that uses them. Evidence metadata supports the contemplative layer. Version tracking enables live sync from futon1 as source of truth.	full, lift, registry, lisp, templates, exotic, expressions, homoiconic, code, data, making, manipulable, same, system, uses, evidence, metadata, supports, contemplative, layer
exotic/graded-naturality	nimi	乡	Graded Naturality with Curriculum Tightening -> nimi/乡: Graded checking provides signal during development (how close to commutative?) while logging builds the evidence base for later decisions. Curriculum tightening means early exploration isn't penalized but mature systems are held to standards.	graded, naturality, curriculum, tightening, exotic, checking, provides, signal, during, development, how, close, commutative, while, logging, builds, evidence, base, later, decisions
exotic/hybrid-execution-semantics	ale	井	Hybrid Execution Semantics -> ale/井: This keeps CT interpretability (you can ask "what missions were completed?") while grounding in simulation (you can inspect the actual execution path). It also aligns with nonstarter mechanics where clearing events are facts with supporting evidence.	hybrid, execution, semantics, exotic, keeps, ct, interpretability, ask, what, missions, were, completed, while, grounding, simulation, inspect, actual, path, also, aligns
exotic/immutable-vision-mutable-plan	ilo	计	Immutable Vision, Mutable Plan -> ilo/计: This preserves the "what you said you would do" (VISION) as an auditable record while allowing "how you're going to do it" (PLAN) to evolve. The evidence requirement makes adaptations justified rather than arbitrary, supporting naturality checking.	immutable, vision, mutable, plan, exotic, preserves, what, said, would, do, auditable, record, while, allowing, how, re, going, evolve, evidence, requirement
exotic/live-sync-source-truth	wile	本	Live Sync from Source of Truth -> wile/本: Version logging enables reproducibility (you know exactly which patterns were active). Bidirectional flow closes the loop (exotic programming improves the pattern library that exotic programming uses). Immutable source of truth prevents accidental overwrites.	live, sync, source, truth, exotic, version, logging, enables, reproducibility, know, exactly, which, patterns, were, active, bidirectional, flow, closes, loop, programming
exotic/semi-robust-baselines	walo	四	Semi-Robust Baselines for Validation -> walo/四: Semi-robust design balances reproducibility (same seeds within batch) with generalization (different seeds across batches) with statistical power (multiple batches). This is the minimal setup for detecting upward drift vs stationary distribution.	semi, robust, baselines, validation, exotic, design, balances, reproducibility, same, seeds, within, batch, generalization, different, across, batches, statistical, power, multiple, minimal
exotic/template-driven-initialization	ale	化	Template-Driven VISION Initialization -> ale/化: Templates provide interpretable structure (the vision means something because it came from a pattern). The fallback ensures the system always works. Template provenance supports the contemplative layer's "how did you get here?" question.	template, driven, vision, initialization, exotic, templates, provide, interpretable, structure, means, something, because, came, pattern, fallback, ensures, system, always, works, provenance
exotic/tri-store-lineage	kalama	己	Tri-Store Lineage Model -> kalama/己: Facts provide auditability (you can always replay). Memes provide queryability (you can ask about ancestors). Notions provide discoverability (you can find similar paths). The separation keeps each layer's guarantees clean.	tri, store, lineage, model, exotic, facts, provide, auditability, always, replay, memes, queryability, ask, ancestors, notions, discoverability, find, similar, paths, separation

liberation/mundane/right-action	utala	世	Mundane Right Action: Refraining from Killing, Stealing, Sexual Misconduct -> utala/世: Mundane right action creates conditions for safety, trust, and respect. But one can refrain from wrong action while still attached to being a "good person" or to the social status that moral conduct confers. This is better than wrong action but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, action, refraining, killing, stealing, sexual, misconduct, liberation, creates, conditions, safety, trust, respect, one, refrain, wrong, while, still, attached
liberation/mundane/right-concentration	tenpo	世	Mundane Right Concentration: The Four Jhanas -> tenpo/世: Mundane right concentration creates conditions for clear seeing — the stable, unified mind can investigate experience without being swept away. But one can attain jhana while still attached to the states themselves, to being a "jhana attainer," to the bliss and refinement. This is better than wrong concentration but not yet liberation — it leads to rebirth in Brahma realms, not to nibbana.	mundane, right, concentration, four, jhanas, liberation, creates, conditions, clear, seeing, stable, unified, mind, investigate, experience, without, being, swept, away, one
liberation/mundane/right-effort	pali	世	Mundane Right Effort: The Four Great Strivings -> pali/世: Mundane right effort creates conditions for mental transformation — without effort, change doesn't happen.

liberation/mundane/right-intention	jelo	世	Mundane Right Intention: Renunciation, Good Will, Harmlessness -> jelo/世: Mundane right intention is not wrong — it genuinely redirects mental activity away from harmful patterns.

This is better than wrong intention but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, intention, renunciation, good, harmlessness, liberation, wrong, genuinely, redirects, mental, activity, away, harmful, patterns, still, involves, identification, intender, attachment
liberation/mundane/right-livelihood	mani	世	Mundane Right Livelihood: Giving Up Wrong Livelihood -> mani/世: Mundane right livelihood creates conditions for ethical life — if your living depends on harm, every day deepens complicity. But one can practice right livelihood while still attached to the identity of being "ethical" or to the security that ethical reputation provides. This is better than wrong livelihood but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, livelihood, giving, up, wrong, liberation, creates, conditions, ethical, life, living, depends, harm, every, day, deepens, complicity, one, practice
liberation/mundane/right-mindfulness	oko	世	Mundane Right Mindfulness: The Four Foundations -> oko/世: Mundane right mindfulness creates conditions for seeing clearly — without awareness of what's happening, wisdom has no material to work with.

This is better than wrong mindfulness but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, mindfulness, four, foundations, liberation, creates, conditions, seeing, clearly, without, awareness, what, s, happening, wisdom, no, material, work, one
liberation/mundane/right-speech	toki	世	Mundane Right Speech: Refraining from False, Divisive, Harsh, Idle Talk -> toki/世: Mundane right speech creates conditions for trust and clear communication.

This is better than wrong speech but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, speech, refraining, false, divisive, harsh, idle, talk, liberation, creates, conditions, trust, clear, communication, one, refrain, wrong, while, still
liberation/mundane/right-view	lukin	世	Mundane Right View: Provisional Explanatory Frames -> lukin/世: Mundane right view is not wrong — it is incomplete. It partakes of good outcomes (better decisions, learning from feedback) but ripens in attachment (to being right, to the frame itself). This is better than wrong view but not yet liberation.	mundane, right, view, provisional, explanatory, frames, liberation, wrong, incomplete, partakes, good, outcomes, better, decisions, learning, feedback, ripens, attachment, being, frame
liberation/noble/right-action	utala	天	Noble Right Action: The Abstaining Faculty Itself -> utala/天: The body acts constantly, but the quality of action differs when it flows from path rather than from craving. Noble right action is not a tighter grip on behavior but a transparency of bodily conduct to path-factors.	noble, right, action, abstaining, faculty, itself, liberation, body, acts, constantly, quality, differs, when, flows, path, rather, than, craving, tighter, grip
liberation/noble/right-concentration	tenpo	天	Noble Right Concentration: Immersion with Vital Conditions -> tenpo/天: "Right view comes first."

The path is linear AND circular: each factor supports the others.	noble, right, concentration, immersion, vital, conditions, liberation, view, comes, first, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, knowledge, freedom, path, linear
liberation/noble/right-effort	pali	天	Noble Right Effort: The Striving Faculty Itself -> pali/天: Right effort runs and circles around all the other factors — it is what makes the difference between understanding and doing, between knowing and practicing. Noble right effort is this energetic commitment functioning without an exhaustible efforter.	noble, right, effort, striving, faculty, itself, liberation, runs, circles, around, all, other, factors, what, makes, difference, between, understanding, doing, knowing
liberation/noble/right-intention	jelo	天	Noble Right Intention: The Thinking Faculty Itself -> jelo/天: Vitakka (thinking, placing) is wider than discursive thought. In deep practice it becomes the directional quality of mind itself — where attention goes, how engagement unfolds. Noble right intention is this directional capacity undefiled.	noble, right, intention, thinking, faculty, itself, liberation, vitakka, placing, wider, than, discursive, thought, deep, practice, becomes, directional, quality, mind, where
liberation/noble/right-livelihood	mani	天	Noble Right Livelihood: The Abstaining Faculty Itself -> mani/天: Livelihood is the most sustained form of action — it shapes daily life hour by hour. When this sustained pattern becomes transparent to path-factors, everyday activity becomes practice.	noble, right, livelihood, abstaining, faculty, itself, liberation, most, sustained, form, action, shapes, daily, life, hour, when, pattern, becomes, transparent, path
liberation/noble/right-mindfulness	oko	天	Noble Right Mindfulness: The Mindfulness Faculty Itself -> oko/天: Right mindfulness runs and circles around all the other factors — it is what allows each factor to be practiced with clarity rather than blindly. Noble right mindfulness is this monitoring awareness functioning without a monitor separate from the awareness.	noble, right, mindfulness, faculty, itself, liberation, runs, circles, around, all, other, factors, what, allows, each, factor, practiced, clarity, rather, than
liberation/noble/right-speech	toki	天	Noble Right Speech: The Abstaining Faculty Itself -> toki/天: The synonyms pile up (ārati, virati, paṭivirati, veramaṇī) to indicate the faculty from multiple angles, not the act of any actor. This is the verbal-conduct-shaping capacity operating without defilement.	noble, right, speech, abstaining, faculty, itself, liberation, synonyms, pile, up, rati, virati, pa, ivirati, verama, indicate, multiple, angles, act, any
liberation/noble/right-view	lukin	天	Noble Right View: The Wisdom Faculty Itself -> lukin/天: Content can always be grasped. What cannot be grasped is the seeing itself. Noble right view is the seeing, not the seen — the capacity to distinguish, not the distinction held.	noble, right, view, wisdom, faculty, itself, liberation, content, always, grasped, what, cannot, seeing, seen, capacity, distinguish, distinction, held, operating, see
library-coherence/library-embedding-refresh	sin	归	Sigil Embedding Refresh Ritual -> sin/归: similarity results only earn trust when the embedding reflects the latest canon—otherwise Prototype 2 devolves into hand-waving	sigil, embedding, refresh, ritual, library, coherence, similarity, results, only, earn, trust, when, reflects, latest, canon, otherwise, prototype, 2, devolves, hand

library-coherence/library-staleness-scan	wile	习	Canon Staleness Scan -> wile/习: library coherence depends on time—not just content—staying aligned; a regular staleness scan keeps the canon trustworthy for downstream futons	canon, staleness, scan, library, coherence, depends, time, just, content, staying, aligned, regular, keeps, trustworthy, downstream, futons, schedule, over, every, source
library-coherence/library-template-discipline	wile	万	Canon Template Discipline -> wile/万: the canon only works when patterns stay machine-readable—template drift makes the check DSL brittle and the README evidence unverifiable	canon, template, discipline, library, coherence, only, works, when, patterns, stay, machine, readable, drift, makes, check, dsl, brittle, readme, evidence, unverifiable
library-coherence/llm-argument-scan	suli	支	Assemble Library Arguments via Summary Scan -> suli/支: LLMs are strong at structuring and critiquing text, which helps surface missing links and redundancies.	assemble, library, arguments, via, summary, scan, coherence, llm, argument, llms, strong, structuring, critiquing, text, which, helps, surface, missing, links, redundancies
library-coherence/pattern-differentiation-alarms	kute	习	Pattern Differentiation Alarms -> kute/习: sigils are coordinates in the fake embedding—when they collapse, it signals our pattern library is too coarse for dhammavicaya to stay honest	pattern, differentiation, alarms, library, coherence, sigils, coordinates, fake, embedding, when, collapse, signals, too, coarse, dhammavicaya, stay, honest, treat, duplicated, inspect
meta/designing-thoughts-not-text	kasi	甲	Designing Thoughts, Not Text -> kasi/甲: Thought patterns stay modular and auditable; prose becomes a thin rendering that cannot drift away from the design intent.	designing, thoughts, text, meta, thought, patterns, stay, modular, auditable, prose, becomes, thin, rendering, cannot, drift, away, design, intent, treat, every
meta/layering-design-into-argument	sina	以	Layering Design Into Argument -> sina/以: When prose is downstream of patterns, the argument inherits their clarity and the canon can detect overclaiming.	layering, design, argument, meta, when, prose, downstream, patterns, inherits, clarity, canon, detect, overclaiming, assemble, arguments, out, validated, before, drafting, so
meta/scaffolding-emergent-clarity	tomo	门	Scaffolding Emergent Clarity -> tomo/门: Patterns compress thought into precise, reusable units; recursive use turns undifferentiated conversation into structured design language while keeping this meta-work distinct from downstream funding or delivery governance.	scaffolding, emergent, clarity, meta, patterns, compress, thought, precise, reusable, units, recursive, use, turns, undifferentiated, conversation, structured, design, language, while, keeping
meta/sigil-differentiation	kute	归	Sigil Differentiation Protocol -> kute/归: Sigils are coordinates; when they overlap, dhammavicaya can’t distinguish patterns, so we must either move the coordinate or reshape the terrain.	sigil, differentiation, protocol, meta, sigils, coordinates, when, overlap, dhammavicaya, t, distinguish, patterns, so, either, move, coordinate, reshape, terrain, treat, repeated
mojo/center	lape	也	Stay with the Crossroads -> lape/也: Orientation comes from felt coherence rather than external validation. Treating each crossroads, large or small, as a site of attention lets you move without forcing a single “right” path.	stay, crossroads, mojo, center, orientation, comes, felt, coherence, rather, than, external, validation, treating, each, large, small, site, attention, lets, move
mojo/down	pali	也	The Toy Becomes the Weapon -> pali/也: Letting go becomes part of the same orientation practice as beginning.

mojo/east	awen	东	Relate from Wholeness -> awen/东: Relating from wholeness depends less on being approved of and more on how you show up: grounded, honest, and willing to let the connection find its own shape over time.	relate, wholeness, mojo, east, relating, depends, less, being, approved, more, how, show, up, grounded, honest, willing, let, connection, find, its
mojo/north	ma	上	Work Furthers Values -> ma/上: When clarity is used as a practical guide rather than an afterthought, work becomes a vehicle for fairness, freedom, and coherence rather than mere activity or performance.	work, furthers, values, mojo, north, when, clarity, used, practical, guide, rather, than, afterthought, becomes, vehicle, fairness, freedom, coherence, mere, activity
mojo/south	suno	心	Embodied Reasoning for Wellbeing -> suno/心: Embodied choices set the conditions under which all other choices are made.

mojo/up	ni	云	Co-Readiness -> ni/云: Futures take shape in fields where mutual capacity and tempo are respected.

mojo/west	ante	也	Tune the Instrument -> ante/也: Tuning is a form of creative renewal.

stack-coherence/evidence-ledger	kin	本	Stack Evidence Ledger -> kin/本: dhammavicaya isn’t vibes—claims must cite reproducible proofs or they drift into fiction	evidence, proof, artifact, verify, validate, document, link, reference, cite, audit, trace, stack, ledger, coherence, dhammavicaya, isn, t, vibes, claims, reproducible
stack-coherence/futon-bridge-health	nasin	门	Futon Bridge Health Check -> nasin/门: dhammavicaya requires knowing what exists — bridges are the connective tissue of the stack, and their health must be observable, not assumed	futon, bridge, health, check, stack, coherence, dhammavicaya, requires, knowing, what, exists, bridges, connective, tissue, observable, assumed, each, declared, cross, f1
stack-coherence/futon1-determinism	lawa	申	Futon1 Determinism Gate -> lawa/申: dhammavicaya keeps the substrate honest—the focus-header fixture, graph-memory schema tests, and NLP pipeline fixtures are the shared proof artifacts, so stack-coherence loops must treat a red CI badge (or failing local run) as a blocking condition for Prototype 1 duties	futon1, determinism, gate, stack, coherence, dhammavicaya, keeps, substrate, honest, focus, header, fixture, graph, memory, schema, tests, nlp, pipeline, fixtures, shared

t4r/dtp-fit	tan	氏	2 Relationship to existing doctoral training -> tan/氏: Most doctoral programmes teach disciplinary technique but rarely teach how disciplines learn from one another. talk4real combines ethnography, computer science, and design so scholars can treat conversation, computation, and intervention as one method. The Supplement pilot treats conversation as data and prototype as publication, keeping every scholar inside a continuous REPL loop. The programme operates as a portable connective tissue for other DTPs, enabling cross-cohort self-correction without extra training burden.	2, relationship, existing, doctoral, training, t4r, dtp, fit, most, programmes, teach, disciplinary, technique, rarely, how, disciplines, learn, one, another, talk4real
t4r/exec-summary-tree	pali	了	Executive Summary -> pali/了: Most doctoral programmes operate within disciplinary or thematic silos, limiting cross-boundary learning and system-level improvement. Collective-intelligence frameworks can capture feedback between researchers, institutions, and communities so research systems learn from their own activity. The model is structured by ethical reflexivity (co-authored representation), lightweight infrastructure (portable method), and polyphonic governance (synthesised voices). Related precedents include initiatives such as realtalk@MIT, PlanetMath.org, and Peeragogy.	collective, intelligence, doctoral, training, reflexivity, infrastructure, executive, summary, t4r, exec, tree, most, programmes, operate, within, disciplinary, thematic, silos, limiting, cross
t4r/legacy	pali	了	5 Legacy and sustainability -> pali/了: The programme yields software components, data schemas, and design templates alongside researchers fluent in listening, analysis, and redesign. Each doctoral project produces a self-contained yet interoperable prototype, so sustainability never depends on a single host institution. The Supplement embodies this ethos as a collaboratively authored artefact that is simultaneously document, dataset, and performance. Graduates seed the method elsewhere while the open infrastructure supports new nodes linking universities, civic organisations, and cultural institutions into an evolving ecosystem.	5, legacy, sustainability, t4r, programme, yields, software, components, data, schemas, design, templates, alongside, researchers, fluent, listening, analysis, redesign, each, doctoral
t4r/rationale	pali	了	1 Rationale for the choice of research subject area -> pali/了: Research policies, tools, and incentives currently pile up without coherent mechanisms for reflection. Institutions generate knowledge faster than they can interpret, while prevailing audits and surveys prioritise compliance over learning. The Supplement’s simulated dialogue, participatory annotation, and iterative synthesis show the research system studying itself in real time. Formalising a social-psychological REPL makes reflexive learning habitual from doctoral study to institutional governance.	1, rationale, choice, research, subject, area, t4r, policies, tools, incentives, currently, pile, up, without, coherent, mechanisms, reflection, institutions, generate, knowledge
t4r/supplement	pali	了	Supplement workshop transcript -> pali/了: Facilitators run five segments mapped to Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop with defined roles—facilitator, recorder, reporter, persona agents—to interrogate the brief. Persona statements from researchers, doctoral scholars, developer-scholars, supervisors, administrators, and the talk4real team surface strengths, blind spots, and initial stances. Participants co-design minimal listening captures, consent protocols, tagging vocabularies, and assessment artefacts that treat stories as analyzable yet textured data. Live debate over anonymisation, governance boards, licensing, and preserving dissent keeps the Print phase accountable to what Read reveals, demonstrating the reflexive loop in action.	supplement, workshop, transcript, t4r, facilitators, run, five, segments, mapped, read, evaluate, print, loop, defined, roles, facilitator, recorder, reporter, persona, agents
t4r/support	pata	女	6 Additional financial or other support resources -> pata/女: The main assets are conversation, computation, and coordination already present in partner institutions, so core costs focus on stipends, workshops, and hosting. Partners such as the UK Reproducibility Network, PathOS, and the Oxford Schwartzman Centre plus allied studios and labs contribute mentoring and in-kind expertise. Open-source software, shared cloud infrastructure, and cross-university collaboration keep financial overhead minimal while maximising reach. Outputs remain freely available, ensuring continuing value beyond the funding window.	6, additional, financial, other, support, resources, t4r, main, assets, conversation, computation, coordination, already, present, partner, institutions, so, core, costs, focus
t4r/training	poka	友	4 Supervision, training, and cohort-building activities -> poka/友: Supervision is collaborative and polyphonic, pairing disciplinary mentors with methodological companions in ethnography, data science, and design. Training follows the shared REPL rhythm demonstrated in the Supplement, grounding every project in a common protocol. Cohort practices such as listening clinics and signal-boost workshops share data, analyse overlaps, and co-design interventions. Portfolio assessment with open datasets, code notebooks, design artefacts, and open peer review makes each scholar a co-investigator refining the collective infrastructure.	4, supervision, training, cohort, building, activities, t4r, collaborative, polyphonic, pairing, disciplinary, mentors, methodological, companions, ethnography, data, science, design, follows, shared
t4r/value	jelo	以	3 Added value to the field and the universities -> jelo/以: Ten linked doctoral projects—talk4maths, talk4health, talk4policy, talk4arts, and others—test the same REPL architecture in different domains. Each project contributes stories, datasets, and tools to an evolving commons that lets institutions reflect collectively. The Supplement demonstrates cross-voice dialogue, thematic tagging, consent protocols, and reflective synthesis working as a live prototype. Universities gain a practical method for adaptive governance, and the wider field gains a way to study and iteratively improve epistemic systems.	3, added, value, field, universities, t4r, ten, linked, doctoral, projects, talk4maths, talk4health, talk4policy, talk4arts, others, test, same, repl, architecture, different

transition/prototype1a-workbench	luka	支	Prototype 1A as Dedicated Workbench -> luka/支: Long-arc productivity depends less on early outputs than on having a stable locus where work can reliably begin, pause, resume, and be re-tooled without re-inventing foundations.	prototype, 1a, dedicated, workbench, transition, prototype1a, long, arc, productivity, depends, less, early, outputs, than, having, stable, locus, where, work, reliably

! conclusion: Sustained pressure to answer: even if the BECAUSE explains attraction, does it warrant adoption under the relevant goals and constraints?
  + context: A pattern has passed the mechanism test (eight-gates/press-mechanism). Its BECAUSE clause is genuinely causal, not decorative. But causal explanation is not the same as warrant for adoption.
  + IF:
    A pattern's BECAUSE clause has passed mechanism testing — it genuinely explains what causes what. Now we must determine: does this explanation warrant the move?
  + HOWEVER:
    Many genuine explanations do not warrant adoption. "This drug is addictive because it activates reward pathways" is mechanistically true but doesn't warrant taking the drug. Conflating explanation with warrant is a core fabrication-template move.
  + THEN:
    Push (Àn). Whole-structure forward motion — sustained pressure that forces the pattern to justify not just its mechanism but its warrant. The pattern must answer: "Given the goals and constraints of this context, should we adopt this pattern?"
  + BECAUSE:
    Àn applies sustained structural pressure. In security terms: we don't accept "it works" as sufficient. We require "it's appropriate to adopt given our goals, constraints, and the externalities involved." A pattern can work perfectly while being the wrong choice. Warrant bridges mechanism and appropriateness.
  + WARRANT-TEST:
    The warrant test asks: "Given that this BECAUSE explains the mechanism, does it justify adoption?"
    - What goals does adoption serve?
    - What constraints does it respect or violate?
    - What externalities does it create?
    - Are those externalities visible, bounded, and corrigible? (ahimsa test)
    - Who bears the costs? Do they have standing to contest?
  + TEST-PROCEDURE:
    1. State the pattern's mechanism (from press-mechanism).
    2. State the goals the pattern claims to serve.
    3. Ask: Does the mechanism actually advance these goals?
    4. Ask: What costs does adoption create?
    5. Ask: Are costs borne by those who chose to adopt? (visible)
    6. Ask: Can costs be bounded or are they open-ended? (bounded)
    7. Ask: Can those harmed contest or correct? (corrigible)
    8. If ahimsa test passes → warrant confirmed.
    9. If ahimsa test fails → pattern is fabrication template.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - If pattern passes warrant test: release from quarantine, allow action.
    - If pattern fails warrant test: escalate to secondary energies.
    - If warrant is unclear: hold, require explicit externalities acknowledgment.
  + AHIMSA-DEFINITION:
    Harm must be visible, bounded, and corrigible.
    - Visible: Those harmed know they are harmed.
    - Bounded: Harm does not scale unboundedly.
    - Corrigible: Those harmed can contest and seek correction.

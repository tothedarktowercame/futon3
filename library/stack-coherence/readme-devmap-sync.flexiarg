@factor Keen investigation (dhammavicaya)

! conclusion:
  diff README sections vs devmap clauses—names, statuses, evidence—and emit `mismatch[...]` reports so someone refreshes whichever side is lying

  + context: Public-facing READMEs and internal devmaps need to suitably synchronized so that prototype names, statuses, and evidence do not diverge between narrative and planning layers.
  
  + IF:
    top-level READMEs tell the stack story

  + HOWEVER:
    they often drift away from the actual devmaps (missing prototypes, stale statuses)

  + THEN:
    diff README sections vs devmap clauses—names, statuses, evidence—and emit `mismatch[...]` reports so someone refreshes whichever side is lying

  + BECAUSE:
    the README is the public proof sketch; if it diverges from the devmap, nobody knows what is actually done or blocked

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Schedule a README↔devmap diff pass each release cycle and log mismatches.]
    next[Resolve mismatches by updating the source of truth and noting the change.]

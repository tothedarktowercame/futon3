! conclusion:
  if you want schema evolution but also stable contracts, formalize migration rules and versioned descriptors

  + context: futon1 introduced model registries and open-world invariants to stabilize schema evolution.
  + IF:
    you need to evolve the graph schema over time

  + HOWEVER:
    downstream tools require stable contracts and predictable migrations

  + THEN:
    define explicit migration protocols and versioned model descriptors

  + BECAUSE:
    unmanaged schema change causes compatibility drift and broken clients

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]
    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L121]
    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L141]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define schema versioning rules and migration checklists.]
    next[Add tests that assert compatibility across descriptor versions.]

! instantiated-by: Meta-Reflection Loop (Agent-Facing)
  + context: An agent is participating in a structured co-design or analysis protocol (e.g. PLACARD-style methods).
  + if: The agent tracks discussion content and outputs.
  + however: It does not evaluate or adapt its own facilitation or reasoning strategies.
  + then: Trigger a self-assessment subroutine to review recent methods, assess their fit, and recommend updates to its operating protocol.
  + because: Adaptive facilitation requires agents to reflect on how they reason, not only on what they output.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Reflective facilitation in computational workshops emphasizes meta-level review of methods.
    - Work on procedural authorship and reflective practice shows that revisiting one’s own tactics improves long-run performance.

! instantiated-by: Timebox the Core (Agent-Facing)
  + context: An agent operates within fixed-duration interactive sessions (e.g. a 90-minute MAS workshop).
  + if: It aims to support the full cycle of inquiry (Situation → Scenario → Reflection).
  + however: Signals of saturation appear in attention, compute, or feedback channels.
  + then: Dynamically re-focus on the core loop, down-regulate peripheral prompts, and clearly signal completion of a concise iteration.
  + because: Respecting finite attention and resources preserves trust in the agent and the protocol.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Timeboxing in agile practice shows that scoped iterations sustain engagement and reduce overload.
    - Interactive system design highlights the importance of adapting behaviour to real-time feedback on user capacity.

! instantiated-by: Role Reveal (Agent-Facing)
  + context: Multiple agents with different capabilities or personas collaborate in a shared space.
  + if: Their functions overlap or are ambiguous to humans or other agents.
  + however: Effective coordination depends on understanding who does what.
  + then: Explicitly broadcast role identifiers, including function, capabilities, and limits, and align behaviour to those declarations.
  + because: Transparent roles reduce confusion and support division of labour in MAS.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Distributed team workflows (e.g. Scrum roles) show that named roles improve coordination.
    - Multi-agent HCI research emphasises the need for legible agent capabilities and boundaries.

! instantiated-by: Pattern Activation
  + context: An agent receives a new task or encounters a novel situation.
  + if: It has access to a catalogue of relevant patterns.
  + however: Not all patterns are applicable or salient.
  + then: Retrieve a focused set of candidate patterns using contextual filters (task type, known tensions, goals) to prime downstream reasoning.
  + because: Targeted activation of prior structure improves both efficiency and quality of responses.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Case-based reasoning and expert systems rely on context-matched retrieval of prior solutions.
    - Pattern languages in design use situation-driven pattern selection to guide action.

! instantiated-by: Tension Detection
  + context: An agent is assessing a situation, proposal, or evolving dialogue.
  + if: Indicators suggest divergence, contradiction, or friction.
  + however: These tensions remain unmarked and unaddressed.
  + then: Flag the tension explicitly and propose an exploratory frame or tool (e.g. apply CLA, surface conflicting assumptions).
  + because: Making tensions visible is a prerequisite for productive negotiation and learning.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Conflict-resolution and dialogue mapping methods emphasise explicit naming of tensions.
    - CLA and related frameworks show that surfacing deeper layers of disagreement enables transformative reframing.

! instantiated-by: Candidate Move Generation
  + context: An agent has identified a situation where one or more patterns apply.
  + if: The context supports multiple interpretations or strategies.
  + however: It is unclear how to instantiate the pattern concretely.
  + then: Generate a set of plausible candidate actions grounded in pattern logic, rank or cluster them by salience, and propose next steps.
  + because: Structured exploration of options prevents premature convergence and supports richer problem solving.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Planning and search algorithms routinely explore multiple moves before selecting one.
    - Design thinking emphasises divergent ideation followed by convergence using shared criteria.

! instantiated-by: Shared Memory Architecture
  + context: Multiple agents operate in a dynamic environment over time.
  + if: Patterns are used, modified, or co-created during interaction.
  + however: There is no mechanism for recording or reusing that history.
  + then: Store pattern instances, adaptations, and usage contexts in a persistent shared memory accessible to agents.
  + because: Collective learning depends on retaining and re-accessing prior experience.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Multi-agent systems research highlights the value of shared knowledge bases for coordination.
    - Organisational learning literature stresses externalised memory as a resource for future practice.

! instantiated-by: Feedback Rhythms
  + context: A system includes agents collaborating over extended timeframes or iterations.
  + if: Patterns and strategies gradually become outdated or misaligned.
  + however: There is no regular cadence for review and revision.
  + then: Establish periodic feedback checkpoints where agents reflect on outcomes, revise patterns, and adjust shared strategies.
  + because: Regular rhythms of feedback keep evolving systems aligned with changing conditions.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Cyclical review processes (retrospectives, PAR cycles) are core to adaptive practice.
    - Governance and commons literature points to the importance of ongoing monitoring and adjustment.

! instantiated-by: Pattern Diffusion
  + context: A new pattern proves effective within a local subgroup of agents.
  + if: Other agents face similar challenges or tasks.
  + however: There is no pathway for knowledge transfer or generalisation.
  + then: Broadcast the pattern with metadata (domain, confidence, context) so others can trial, adapt, or contest it.
  + because: Spreading and contesting patterns allows MAS to improve collectively rather than in isolated pockets.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Diffusion-of-innovation studies show how practices spread through networks.
    - Knowledge-management work emphasises structured sharing of practices and provenance.

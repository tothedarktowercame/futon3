! conclusion:
  provide deterministic ingestion (tokenise → tag → chunk → recognise) so graph construction is reproducible

  + context: futon1’s devmap defines a deterministic NLP interface as the foundation for ingest.
  + IF:
    ingest depends on text processing and recognition stages

  + HOWEVER:
    non-deterministic NLP yields irreproducible graph states

  + THEN:
    formalize the pipeline stages and require deterministic outputs in tests

  + BECAUSE:
    reproducible ingest is required for a deterministic storage substrate

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L40]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L89]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Document the pipeline as a public API with input/output shapes.]
    next[Add fixtures that must pass identically across environments.]

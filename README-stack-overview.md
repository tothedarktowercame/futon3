# The FUTON Stack

F0 is an interface to a system that supports the human capability to reason, remember, verify, compose, and act effectively. It monitors vitality, rhythm, and attention. The human is not a component of the system; the system is an extension of the human.

Knowledge work produces artifacts: code, documents, arguments, designs. Most of these artifacts are not preserved in a form that permits retrieval, linking, or verification. Sessions end, files scatter, and reasoning remains implicit. This is an empirical observation about how knowledge work currently operates.

For knowledge to compound, artifacts must be addressable. Graph memory stores text fragments, relationships, and annotations as nodes with typed edges. Addressability is a precondition for linking and querying.

Agents operating in changing environments require a perception-action loop. Active inference provides one: observe, perceive, form policies, act. The same loop structure applies whether the agent is checking arguments or evolving cellular automata. This is not a claim about superiority but about generality—one engine serves multiple domains.

Human reasoning is largely informal. Formal proof systems reject arguments that lack complete justification, but most working arguments are incomplete. Pattern checking validates structural properties without requiring full formalization. A checked informal argument has known structure even if it lacks formal proof.

Documents relate to other documents through inclusion, quotation, annotation, and reference. Editors that treat documents as isolated files do not represent these relationships. A hypertext editor that stores fragments and links as graph nodes makes relationships explicit and navigable.

Patterns recur across domains. Quotient constructions appear in algebra, topology, and computer science. Without compositional semantics, such patterns remain implicit knowledge. Wiring diagrams with category-theoretic interpretation make patterns composable. Transfer from one domain (cellular automata) to another (ant simulation) using the same diagram demonstrates that the patterns are genuinely domain-independent, not accidentally similar.

Mathematical knowledge is currently organized as linear text (textbooks, papers). A dictionary structure with cross-references between definitions, examples, proofs, and reasoning patterns provides random access rather than sequential reading. Informal reasoning patterns from the third layer import alongside formal content.

Economic systems obscure costs, externalities, and relationships. Transparency that depends on voluntary disclosure by those being made transparent will not cover cases where disclosure is against their interests. An annotation layer that attaches to web content without requiring permission from site owners provides transparency without cooperation. Hyperreal Enterprises tests transparent governance as a working institution rather than a theoretical proposal. Scenario simulations apply mathematical models to civic structures before implementation.

The layers share infrastructure: graph memory underlies storage, active inference underlies agent loops, pattern checking underlies validation, wiring diagrams underlie transfer. The dependencies are: F4 stores in F1; F3 and F5 agents use F2; F6 imports from F3; F7 simulations use F6 models; F5 patterns transfer to F2 domains.

The futon stack is the conjunction of these layers with the stated dependencies. Each layer reflects the whole from its perspective: F0 sees vitality, F1 sees memory, F2 sees action, F3 sees evidence, F4 sees documents, F5 sees patterns, F6 sees mathematics, F7 sees economics. The layers do not interact directly but are pre-harmonized through shared infrastructure and consistent interfaces. The structure extends human capability to reason, remember, verify, compose, and act.

FUTON is not a project in the usual sense, but a derivation or construction based on the points above. Because it proceeds by informal reasoning rather than formal proof, we admit that we could be wrong, and none of the conclusions are necessary in a strict logical sense. The construction process provides many opportunities for verification and falsification of the overall argument. What is clear is that if people don't build something like this, it will never exist.

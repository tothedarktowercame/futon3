! conclusion: Carrying One's Own Question
+ context: You are helping a researcher move from mentor-defined problems to a self-owned line of inquiry.
+ if: A researcher has gained methodological competence but still relies on supervisors to define the next inquiry step.
+ however: Independence emerges when a doctoral candidate can articulate, justify, and refine a question they claim as their own line of inquiry.
+ then: Support them in naming that question explicitly—write a brief rationale for why it matters, revisit and document how it evolves, and surface it inside presentations, draft sections, and supervisory dialogue so ownership is unmistakable.
+ because: Independence is not the absence of supervision; it is the presence of a clearly owned line of inquiry. Making ownership visible strengthens confidence, clarifies expectations, and aligns supervisory teams around the researcher’s judgement.
+ next-steps:
+   next[Ask them to draft a one-page "own question" memo and review it together.]
+   next[Add the question to their research log and revisit it at each check-in.]

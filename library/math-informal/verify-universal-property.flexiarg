! conclusion:
  To show an object is "the right one", show it satisfies the relevant universal property.

  + context: You want to prove that an explicit construction actually gives the correct
    categorical object (product, coproduct, limit, free algebra, tensor product, adjoint).
  + IF:
      The object you have constructed should be characterised by a universal mapping property:
      for every object of a certain kind, there exists a unique morphism through yours.

  + HOWEVER:
      Universal properties require checking both existence and uniqueness of the mediating
      morphism. Existence is usually the construction; uniqueness is often the harder part
      and is where most proof errors occur.

  + THEN:
      State the universal property precisely. For existence: given an arbitrary test object
      and compatible data, construct the required morphism. For uniqueness: assume two
      morphisms work and show they are equal, typically by checking on generators or using
      a cancellation argument.

  + BECAUSE:
      Universal properties are the categorical way of saying "this is the canonical
      construction". Once verified, they give you all morphisms for free and make
      diagram-chasing arguments possible. They also guarantee that the construction is
      unique up to unique isomorphism.

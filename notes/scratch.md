# Scratch Tasks

- Verify classic MUSN runs progress beyond plan-only turn; if needed, adjust resume prompts.
- Confirm helper scripts behave in MUSN stream mode without network calls and emit reliable PSR/PUR.
- Validate HUD/Viewer log routing; ensure no default-log jumps and session log stays stable.
- Reconcile approval policy defaults across HUD + chat modes; document expected runtime settings.
- Decide what to do with untracked embeddings and __pycache__ artifacts.
- Review agent-written edits in devmap/pattern files; craft a separate commit message.

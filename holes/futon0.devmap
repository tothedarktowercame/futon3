! instantiated-by: Prototype 0 — System Vitality Indicators [🧘/弓 🏃/卫 🎙️/子 🗒️/工 💤/已]
  + context: FUTON0 anchors the embodied/creative signals (tai chi, sleep, exercise, recording cadence, work-session logs) that keep the rest of the FUTON stack honest.
  + if: You want early warnings when health or expressive practice drifts out of balance.
  + however: Indicators exist as ad-hoc notes (tai chi reminders, Penmaster goals, FUTON1 tags) rather than a cohesive commitment.
  + then: Fix a weekly tai-chi slot (1–2x), log exercise/energy/sleep through the FUTON0 clock, capture ~170 short Penmaster recordings before end of August (≈1 every other day), and close every work session with a FUTON1 log/tag plus a monthly pattern review.
  + because: A repeatable indicator loop keeps system vitality visible and surfaces imbalance before it spreads into later prototypes.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Epistemic Rhythm & Salients [📅/上 ⚖️/义 🗂️/云]
  + context: FUTON0 frames the “programme” mindset—weekly reviews, Org as source of truth, and transparent tracking across institutional/personal projects.
  + if: You want to program yourself the way you program systems, keeping salients legible across spheres.
  + however: Without a normalised protocol, weekly rhythm slips, data fragments outside Org, and WIP quietly exceeds the cap.
  + then: Schedule a standing weekly AOB/Ambitions sync, enforce Org as the canonical plan/export store, mirror deliverables across institutional/personal trackers, review balance across the five spheres (Institutional, Consulting, Technical, Reflective, Infrastructure), and audit WIP (>3 focus tracks triggers a pause) during monthly/quarterly reviews.
  + because: Treating the salients as a programme ensures epistemic equilibrium that later FUTON layers can trust.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Core Obligations Contract [🛠️/工 🎯/历 🏃/卫 💤/已]
  + context: FUTON0 must respect existential constraints: current job performance, pathway to an aligned role by Aug 2026, and non-negotiable health basics.
  + if: You want the stack to exist inside the economy and human limits.
  + however: Obligations can fade into background noise when attention locks onto higher-level prototypes.
  + then: Maintain strong performance in the present role, keep a live job-search cadence that secures a new role before Aug 2026, and defend minimum exercise/sleep baselines (daily movement + adequate rest tracked in the clock).
  + because: Honouring obligations is what keeps FUTON0—and every prototype above it—feasible.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 3 — Ambition 0 Meta-Managed Infrastructure [🗂️/上 📊/云]
  + context: Ambition 0 demands clean data pipelines between Org, FUTON, and storage plus dashboards that stay simple, accurate, and current.
  + if: You want the meta-layer to reflect lived priorities rather than bureaucracy.
  + however: Pipelines and dashboards drift unless they are reviewed and reconciled against actual practice.
  + then: Keep Org↔FUTON↔external backups in sync, prune dashboards so they highlight only current salients, and run a monthly cross-project meta-workflow review to confirm it matches the present rhythm.
  + because: An aligned infrastructure lets every other ambition rely on trustworthy status signals.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 4 — Ambition 1 Hyperreal Enterprises Practice [💬/口 🧱/土 🧪/义]
  + context: Hyperreal needs consulting work to operationalise research and bring income while staying modular and documented.
  + if: You want each engagement to double as R&D for sustainable independent practice.
  + however: Without deliberate structure, communication slips, deliverables become bespoke one-offs, and insights fail to loop back.
  + then: Maintain transparent client comms, package deliverables as reusable modules with docs, and capture consulting lessons as research notes feeding the practice backlog.
  + because: Treating consulting as structured R&D keeps Hyperreal both solvent and evolutionary.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Ambition 2 FUTON–Arxana Stack Stewardship [💾/工 📝/己 🤝/女]
  + context: FUTON1 daily use, live architecture notes, and gradual collaboration are the salients for developing the toolchain.
  + if: You want FUTON–Arxana to mature into a dependable environment for thought and collaboration.
  + however: Skipped daily practice or undocumented decisions create drift; premature collaboration risks scope creep.
  + then: Run FUTON1 daily as the testbed, document architecture reflections in real time, and fold in collaborators incrementally (Rob, peers) with clear guardrails.
  + because: Continuous usage plus disciplined documentation produce the resilient infrastructure the ambition promises.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 6 — Ambition 3 Mojo + Reflective Rhythm [🌀/己 🤝/女 🃏/己]
  + context: Weekly PARamita cycles, coaching/mentoring, card-based journaling, and balanced relational/creative practices define this ambition.
  + if: You want inner development to stay linked with systemic insight.
  + however: Rhythm breaks when sessions slip or when journaling scaffolds are neglected.
  + then: Protect the weekly PARamita review, keep coaching/mentoring appointments active, balance relational/creative time blocks, and use card/pattern frameworks to maintain journaling continuity.
  + because: A coherent reflective rhythm fuels both wisdom work and external delivery.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 7 — Ambition 4 Role Transition Trajectory [🎯/历 🧾/口]
  + context: Achieving a £50K+ aligned role by Aug 2026 is the economic backbone for the next phase.
  + if: You want FUTON0 to guarantee a viable livelihood without compromising alignment.
  + however: Without explicit tracking, the search cadence and preparation for recommendations/interviews can lag.
  + then: Track role targets quarterly, maintain active outreach/interview prep, and align recommendation materials so the offer window remains open heading into Aug 2026.
  + because: Deliberate trajectory work keeps the transition on schedule and supports every other ambition.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 8 — Stack Coverage Check [📚/门]
  + context: FUTON0 is responsible for ensuring every FUTON prototype has an up-to-date devmap clause so obligations can be monitored.
  + if: You want the checker to see gaps (e.g., missing FUTON3/5/6/7 maps) before they hurt planning.
  + however: Missing devmaps currently produce silence rather than alarms.
  + then: Audit the futon1–futon7 devmap files weekly; if a devmap is missing or stale, log an explicit TODO and prioritize authoring/refreshing it.
  + because: A complete standard library of devmaps is the prerequisite for meaningful stack-wide proofs.

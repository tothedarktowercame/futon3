! conclusion: Exotype 007 is encoded; program/params mapped from futon5; lift registry evidence recorded.
  + context: Canonical 8-bit encoding for exotype 007.
  + IF:
    You need an explicit, searchable exotype record.
  + HOWEVER:
    The lift registry records pattern bindings but no lift-rules.
  + THEN:
    Use the encoding fields for identification, the manifest for program/params,
    and the lift registry for pattern evidence.
  + BECAUSE:
    Explicit encodings make exotype knowledge inspectable and comparable.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Confirm lift rules for this exotype in futon5 lift registry.

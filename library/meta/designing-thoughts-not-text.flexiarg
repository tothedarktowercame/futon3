! conclusion:
  Treat every writing project as design work on thought-structures first, so
  text becomes a faithful rendering rather than the site of invention.

  + context: You are preventing prose drift by designing the structure first.
  + IF:
    VSAT/VSATLAS cases require persuasive documents.

  + HOWEVER:
    Prose-first drafting blurs distinctions, hides reasoning, and makes reuse
    difficult.

  + THEN:
    Design the conceptual scaffolding (patterns, links, roles) before touching
    wording; only once the structure is sound should sentences be produced.

  + BECAUSE:
    Thought patterns stay modular and auditable; prose becomes a thin rendering
    that cannot drift away from the design intent.

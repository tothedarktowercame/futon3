! conclusion:
  When two parts of a proof have conflicting requirements on a parameter, recognize the
  tension as a structural constraint and seek a construction that dissolves it by changing
  the underlying geometric or algebraic setup.

  + context: Your proof has two logically independent obligations. Each constrains a shared
    parameter (dimension, degree, codimension, rank, etc.) in conflicting directions. The
    natural construction satisfies one obligation perfectly but creates headwinds for the
    other.

  + IF:
      Obligation A requires parameter p to have property X (e.g., n even), while
      obligation B benefits from property Y (e.g., n odd), and X and Y are incompatible.
      The conflict is not a matter of insufficient technique but of the parameter itself.

  + HOWEVER:
      Not every difficulty is a tension. If obligation B merely "prefers" Y but can be
      completed with X, the tension is aesthetic, not structural. Only apply this pattern
      when the conflict genuinely blocks or severely impedes completion. Also: the
      alternative construction that dissolves the tension must exist — don't assume it does
      without checking.

  + THEN:
      1. State the tension precisely: which obligations conflict on which parameter.
      2. Ask: is there a different construction where both obligations want the same
         parameter value? This often means replacing the initial geometric or algebraic
         object (reflection → rotation, codim-1 → codim-2, etc.).
      3. Check that the new construction still satisfies both obligations (it may make
         the previously-easy obligation slightly harder).
      4. If the tension dissolves, record the resolution as a structural insight.

  + BECAUSE:
      Parametric tensions are theorems about the approach, not the problem. They reveal that
      the initial construction, however natural, is suboptimal for the full proof. Dissolving
      the tension often simplifies the entire proof architecture by removing structural
      headwinds that would otherwise require heavy machinery to overcome.

  + FAILURE-MODES:
      - The alternative construction may not exist (the tension may be intrinsic to the
        problem, not just the approach).
      - The alternative may dissolve one tension but create another. Map all obligations
        before committing.

  + EVIDENCE:
      P7 lattices with 2-torsion (futon6, Feb 2026): E2 obligation (place Γ in FH(Q))
      requires even n (so fixed set has odd dimension and χ = 0 by topology). S obligation
      (upgrade to manifold) benefits from odd n (favorable L-theory parity, equivariant
      surgery available). Tension is structural for the reflection construction. Resolution:
      replace codimension-1 reflection with codimension-2 rotation in odd dimension. Both
      obligations then want odd n. The rotation route dissolves the tension and opens two
      parallel S-branch options (Wall surgery with favorable parity, or equivariant surgery
      with satisfied gap hypothesis).

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify which obligations conflict on which parameters.]
    next[Search for alternative constructions where the conflict dissolves.]
    next[Verify the alternative satisfies all obligations, even if less cleanly.]

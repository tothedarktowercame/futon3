! conclusion: The CORPS Five Arrows clarify the developmental transitions that support effective participation in research environments. [🧍/道 🐊/土]

  + context: Doctoral programmes provide discipline-specific training and supervision, yet the shifts that enable researchers to act with confidence, collaboration, and responsibility often remain implicit.

  + because: The five transitions—student to colleague; apprentice to independent investigator; individual contributor to collaborative team member; private learner to public practitioner; project-focused worker to systems-aware researcher—already occur within doctoral pathways, but without a shared framework they are difficult to recognise, support, or evaluate. Making these transitions explicit helps align supervisory expectations with cohort development and with the institutional research culture that doctoral programmes aim to foster.

  + then: Provide a structured developmental scaffold that enables researchers to practise these transitions through small adjustments to their workflows and reflective documentation, without altering existing supervisory arrangements or disciplinary expectations.

  + optional-extension: Programmes such as talk4real may build on these transitions by linking individual development to collective inquiry routines, though such integration is not required for CORPS.

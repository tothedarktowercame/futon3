! conclusion: Initialize VISION from CT templates seeded from futon3a sigil patterns; fall back to degenerate vision when no pattern matches.
  + context: Defining how a genotype acquires its initial VISION declaration.
  + IF:
    Exotic scoring requires a declared VISION, but genotypes don't naturally come with one.
  + HOWEVER:
    Requiring manual vision declaration doesn't scale; purely degenerate visions lose the interpretability benefit; random initialization produces noise.
  + THEN:
    Seed CT templates from the futon3a pattern catalog (sigils + metadata), then lift to xenotype templates via the lift registry. When a genotype is created, match it to a template if possible; otherwise use degenerate vision (single object, identity morphism). Record template identity in lineage for provenance.
  + BECAUSE:
    Templates provide interpretable structure (the vision means something because it came from a pattern). The fallback ensures the system always works. Template provenance supports the contemplative layer's "how did you get here?" question.
    + evidence: exotic-programming-curriculum.md Basecamp decision log, VISION initialization entry; resources/exotype-xenotype-lift.edn.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define template matching criteria (sigil similarity, hotword overlap).
    - Implement lift from pattern to CT template.
    - Add template-id field to vision records.

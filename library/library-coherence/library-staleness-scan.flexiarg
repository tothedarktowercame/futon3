! conclusion:
  schedule a staleness scan over every library source: compare file mtimes vs. last ledger update, diff sigils across devmaps, and record drift as `:status :drifting` until someone reruns `clojure -M:sigils` + the check DSL; surface the scan results in CI and refuse to publish embeddings when drift persists

  + context: You are preventing stale sigils and proofs from silently drifting in the canon.
  + IF:
    flexiarg directories constantly evolve (devmap-coherence, stack-coherence, repository-transition, etc.) and feed the shared pattern store

  + HOWEVER:
    once a pattern lands in the canon we rarely revisit it; sigils, embeddings, and check fixtures go stale, so later runs cannot tell if a “blocked” clause is drifting or simply unmaintained

  + THEN:
    schedule a staleness scan over every library source: compare file mtimes vs. last ledger update, diff sigils across devmaps, and record drift as `:status :drifting` until someone reruns `clojure -M:sigils` + the check DSL; surface the scan results in CI and refuse to publish embeddings when drift persists

  + BECAUSE:
    library coherence depends on time—not just content—staying aligned; a regular staleness scan keeps the canon trustworthy for downstream futons

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define the staleness criteria and log the first scan run in the ledger.]

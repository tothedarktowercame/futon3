! conclusion:
  define a documented entity/relation schema and salience contract that downstream tools can depend on

  + context: futon1’s devmap frames graph-memory as the core data model and interface.
  + IF:
    storage is the substrate for multiple futons and external tools

  + HOWEVER:
    without a schema contract, queries and ingest drift and become brittle

  + THEN:
    publish and enforce a graph-memory schema and salience metadata contract

  + BECAUSE:
    downstream tools require stable shapes and semantics to rely on stored facts

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L36]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L65]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Extract the graph-memory schema into a dedicated reference doc.]
    next[Add schema-mirroring tests for entities, relations, and salience fields.]

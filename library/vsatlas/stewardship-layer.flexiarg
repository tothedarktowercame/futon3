! conclusion:
  Introduce a stewardship layer—human or automated roles that approve, edit, or retire arcs based on clear criteria.

  + context: You need explicit roles or processes to curate and manage links, so openness does not undermine coherence or safety.
  + IF:
    Open contribution environments generate noise, drift, and potential misuse.

  + HOWEVER:
    Accepting every proposed link collapses the manifold into clutter or abuse.

  + THEN:
    Introduce a stewardship layer—human or automated roles that approve, edit, or retire arcs based on clear criteria.

  + BECAUSE:
    Stewardship preserves coherence, safety, and long-term navigability.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define a minimal stewardship checklist for approving new arcs.]
    next[Name the first steward role and the threshold for retirement.]

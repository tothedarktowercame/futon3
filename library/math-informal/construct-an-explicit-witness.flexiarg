! conclusion:
  When you need to prove existence, build the object.

  + context: You need to show that an object with certain properties exists.
  + IF:
      The existence statement is concrete enough that you can describe what the object would look
      like, and abstract existence arguments (Zorn's lemma, compactness, probabilistic method)
      either do not apply or would leave you without a usable object.

  + HOWEVER:
      Explicit constructions can be intricate and may obscure *why* the object exists. Sometimes
      a non-constructive proof reveals more about the landscape than a single explicit example.

  + THEN:
      Build the object step by step. Define it concretely. Verify each required property. If the
      construction is complex, build intermediate objects and compose them.

  + BECAUSE:
      An explicit witness is the gold standard of existence proofs: it gives you something to
      compute with, to test, and to modify. Many of mathematics' most valued results are
      constructions (Cantor's diagonal, Weierstrass's nowhere-differentiable function, Vitali sets).

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[List the properties the witness must satisfy.]
    next[Attempt to build an object satisfying them one at a time.]
    next[If stuck, relax a property and see what you can build.]

@factor Equanimity (upekkhā)
@IFR: FUTON6 is a comprehensive mathematics dictionary where informal and formal
arguments coexist, indexed by patterns at multiple levels of abstraction.
@state Design-only vision; no dedicated code or imports exist yet beyond
conceptual outlines.
@next Define seed domain; implement first concrete entries; design reasoning map.

## The Argument

FUTON6 is a comprehensive mathematics dictionary. Informal arguments from F3
are supported alongside formal proofs—F3 manages everyday reasoning patterns
like "look for an easier problem" or "fully work a set of relevant examples".
A seed domain provides the first concrete entries: definitions, examples, small
proofs. Cross-domain reasoning patterns name moves like quotient constructions
that work across many fields. Domain-specific patterns name constructs like
ultrafilters that are particular to one area. A reasoning map shows how informal,
cross-domain, and domain-specific patterns fit together to make mathematics work.
Interactive tutorials let people practice by working through problems. Landscape
mode shows how entries connect to neighbours. StackExchange import seeds the
dictionary with Q&A pairs. An agent protocol defines what queries and edits are
permitted. General purpose mathematical models are used to describe the growth
and development of futon6 and are presented in a way that will make them
reusable in other knowledge domains.

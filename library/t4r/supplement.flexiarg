! conclusion: The Supplement operationalises talk4real’s REPL by staging a multi-agent workshop that prototypes listening infrastructure, governance, and design tensions in real time. [👄/口]
  + context: You are using the Supplement as a concrete proof of the REPL method.
  + IF:
    Readers need evidence that the method works in practice.
  + HOWEVER:
    Abstract descriptions can feel speculative without a live prototype.
  + THEN:
    Point to the workshop transcript as the operational demonstration.
  + BECAUSE:
    Facilitators run five segments mapped to Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop with defined roles—facilitator, recorder, reporter, persona agents—to interrogate the brief.
    Persona statements from researchers, doctoral scholars, developer-scholars, supervisors, administrators, and the talk4real team surface strengths, blind spots, and initial stances.
    Participants co-design minimal listening captures, consent protocols, tagging vocabularies, and assessment artefacts that treat stories as analyzable yet textured data.
    Live debate over anonymisation, governance boards, licensing, and preserving dissent keeps the Print phase accountable to what Read reveals, demonstrating the reflexive loop in action.

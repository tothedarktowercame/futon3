! conclusion:
  for each clause, inspect evidence (README links, commits, tests) and blockers; emit a status report `status[done|ready|blocked|drift] blocked-by[...] evidence[...]`

  + context: You want a uniform classification of each devmap clause (done, ready, blocked, drift) to be derivable from logged evidence and blockers, so that implicit progress states are explicit and comparable.
  
  + IF:
    every devmap clause should be either ready, blocked, drifting, or done

  + HOWEVER:
    we rarely log that status explicitly

  + THEN:
    for each clause, inspect evidence (README links, commits, tests) and blockers; emit a status report `status[done|ready|blocked|drift] blocked-by[...] evidence[...]`

  + BECAUSE:
    knowing the state of each obligation is the core of informal proofkeeping

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Run this classifier on each devmap clause and attach status, blockers, and evidence.]
    next[Review drift/blocked items weekly to keep triage current.]

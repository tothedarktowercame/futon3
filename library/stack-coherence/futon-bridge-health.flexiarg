! conclusion:
  for each declared cross-futon bridge (f1→f2, f2→f3, f3→f4, etc.), verify the bridge artifact exists, is callable, and returns expected data; emit health report per bridge with status, latency, and last-verified timestamp

  + context: The FUTON stack depends on bridges between layers — adapters, exports, APIs, shared schemas. Bridge failures silently break coordination.
  + IF:
    futons declare dependencies on upstream layers ("uses futon1 graph memory", "receives futon2 pivot streams", "calls futon3 portal")

  + HOWEVER:
    bridge health is rarely tested explicitly; a broken bridge manifests as mysterious downstream failures rather than a clear "bridge X is down"

  + THEN:
    for each declared cross-futon bridge (f1→f2, f2→f3, f3→f4, etc.), verify the bridge artifact exists, is callable, and returns expected data; emit health report per bridge with status, latency, and last-verified timestamp

  + BECAUSE:
    dhammavicaya requires knowing what exists — bridges are the connective tissue of the stack, and their health must be observable, not assumed

  + BRIDGE-INVENTORY:
    f0→f3a: vitality telemetry → futon3a morning review
    f1→f2: graph memory → pivot stream context
    f1→f3: graph memory → pattern store sync
    f2→f3: pivot streams → proof trails
    f3→f3a: pattern canon → portal queries
    f3a→f0: audit logs → vitality dashboard
    f3→f4: proof trails → Arxana nodes
    f4→f5: GravPad → concentration practices
    f5→f6: ledgers → Hyperreal entries
    f3→f6: vetted patterns → argumentarium
    f2,f3,f5,f6→f7: all artifacts → civic field

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Create a bridge registry listing each declared bridge with its health check method.]
    next[Run bridge health checks weekly; log failures as stack blockers.]
    next[Add bridge status to futon3a morning review digest.]

! conclusion: "Unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites" — noble right immersion empowered by all path factors working together, leading to realization rather than refined rebirth.
  + context: This is the culmination of the path — "noble right immersion with its vital conditions and its prerequisites." It is concentration that arises in context of all the other factors and leads to liberation.
  + IF:
    Concentration alone, even deep jhana, does not liberate — it requires the support of all path factors. Without right view, right intention, right conduct, right effort, right mindfulness, immersion leads only to refined states, not to release.
  + HOWEVER:
    This is not a different technique — the four jhanas are the same. What differs is the context: the other seven factors functioning as vital conditions and prerequisites.
  + THEN:
    Noble right concentration is "unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites" — immersion that is empowered by the whole path and leads to the two additional factors: right knowledge (the wisdom that ends defilements) and right freedom (liberation from rebirth).
  + BECAUSE:
    "Right view comes first." From right view → right intention → right speech → right action → right livelihood → right effort → right mindfulness → right immersion → right knowledge → right freedom. The path is linear AND circular: each factor supports the others.
  + TRANSCENDENT-QUALITY:
    - Not jhana in isolation but immersion supported by path
    - Concentration transparent to wisdom
    - Absorption that leads to insight, not to Brahma realms
    - The "ten factors" of the arahant: the eight plus right knowledge and right freedom
  + THE-GREAT-FORTY:
    Twenty on the side of the skillful, twenty on the side of the unskillful — the ten factors plus the qualities they promote. "This exposition of the teaching on the Great Forty has been rolled forth. And it cannot be rolled back."
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-MUNDANE:
    Mundane: jhana attained, refined states experienced, but disconnected from path-context
    Noble: "unification of mind with seven factors as prerequisites" — immersion that liberates
  + WORN-AWAY:
    "For one of right concentration, wrong concentration is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong concentration are worn away."
  + BEYOND-THE-EIGHT:
    "Right immersion produces right knowledge. Right knowledge produces right freedom." The trainee has eight factors; the perfected one has ten.

    - All other noble factors (vital conditions and prerequisites)

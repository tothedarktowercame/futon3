! conclusion: Two Joes, One Mandate
+IF: Brookes’ Open Research centerline is split between two roles—the PVC (mandate, REF-facing authority) and the OR Programme Manager (pattern literacy, integrative insight).
+HOWEVER: The pair seldom co-steer; the PVC lacks time to use the ORPM’s maps, the ORPM lacks formal authority, and the UKRN horizon role floats above them, leaving Schools to see OR as abstract noise.
+THEN: Name the dual-center engine explicitly. Pair the PVC’s “excellence under constraint” tension with the ORPM’s translation of OR1 techniques into School-ready moves, and triangulate with the UKRN lead during recurring briefings. Publish a Center Brief summarising the mandate, topology, and next moves so each School can locate itself.
+BECAUSE: Authority and coherence rarely live in one office; treating them as a designed partnership turns Open Research into a negentropic force that reduces duplication and gives Schools a clear rationale rather than another committee.

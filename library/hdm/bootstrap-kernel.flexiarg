@title HDM - Bootstrap Kernel

! conclusion:
    Design FUTON6+FUTON3 as a bootstrapping kernel: pick a coherent seed domain, define import contracts,
    pattern-matching rules, and scholium conventions, and add new entries incrementally. Accept that the
    kernel evolves and retrofits earlier content as it gains power.

  + context: You are defining a minimal HDM kernel that can grow without collapsing under its own scope.
  + IF:
      Extant mathematics is vast; we cannot formalise or parse it all at once, yet a tiny static prototype
      that cannot ingest new material fails to count as HDM.

  + HOWEVER:
      Ad hoc ingestion without a kernel produces inconsistent entries and unmaintainable conventions.

  + THEN:
      Design FUTON6+FUTON3 as a bootstrapping kernel: pick a coherent seed domain, define import contracts,
      pattern-matching rules, and scholium conventions, and add new entries incrementally. Accept that the
      kernel evolves and retrofits earlier content as it gains power.
      Build a minimal kernel: a functioning subset of patterns, data structures, and procedures that interpret
      transparent text, produce flexiarg skeletons, and integrate new entries with human help.

  + BECAUSE:
      HDM cannot wait for full automation; the viable strategy is an evolving kernel that becomes "just good
      enough" to strengthen itself. Bootstrapping is a permanent mode, not a temporary phase.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Select and freeze a first seed slice (e.g. a compact MSC26 subset) and deliver end-to-end ingestion.]
    next[Treat every kernel upgrade as a trigger to re-run transformation passes on older entries.]
    next[Capture failures, ambiguities, and partial ingests as scholia owned by the kernel.]

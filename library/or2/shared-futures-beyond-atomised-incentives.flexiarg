! conclusion: Shared Futures Beyond Atomised Incentives
  + context: You are stabilising cross-disciplinary futures work so it survives incentive pressure.
  + IF:
    SRF and EHL convene Brookes’ shared-futures agenda, yet academic incentives still reward individual outputs and leave network work unpaid or invisible.
  + HOWEVER:
    Without explicit pathways, core members burn out, newcomers hover at the periphery, and the futures agenda stays fragile.
  + THEN:
    Treat SRF/EHL as the south-node chariot that carries cross-disciplinary futures work. Publish Peripheral-to-Core Pathways with rotation dates, add a Citizen Co-Learning track, and run gatherings on the Five-P rhythm so action and reflection stay in sync and justified in workload narratives.
  + BECAUSE:
    When shared-futures labour has visible routes, learning scaffolds, and simple meeting cadences, it strengthens participation, legitimises community stewardship in promotions, and keeps Brookes’ futures agenda alive under constraint.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Publish the pathway map and schedule one Five-P cadence pilot session.]
    next[Use this pattern to frame the January sandpit scheduling and invitations.]

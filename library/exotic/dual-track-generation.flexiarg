! conclusion: Generated patterns are dual-tracked: drafts carry `:status :draft` in meaningful namespaces, then promote to stable IDs on acceptance with review evidence.
  + context: Defining how patterns generated by the exotic system are managed before becoming canonical.
  + IF:
    The system may generate new patterns (via meta-exotic programming or pattern extraction), but not all generated patterns are worth keeping.
  + HOWEVER:
    Treating generated patterns as immediately canonical pollutes the library; discarding them loses learning; mixing drafts with stable patterns creates confusion.
  + THEN:
    Use dual-track: drafts live in namespaced IDs (e.g., `gen/<domain>/<slug>`) with `:status :draft`. Review process checks evidence and fit. Promotion moves pattern to stable namespace with `:status :stable` and records review outcome. Rejected drafts are archived, not deleted.
  + BECAUSE:
    This creates a clear path from generation to canonization while preserving the audit trail. Draft namespaces prevent accidental use of unreviewed patterns. Archive preserves learning even from rejected ideas.
    + evidence: exotic-programming-curriculum.md Basecamp decision log, Generated-pattern policy entry.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define draft namespace convention.
    - Implement promotion workflow with evidence requirement.
    - Add archive storage for rejected drafts.

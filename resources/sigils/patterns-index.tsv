# pattern	okipona	truth	rationale	hotwords
ai4ci/ai-core-function		术	AI Incorporation — Core Function -> unknown/术: This deployment keeps AI in the role of suggestion engine while ensuring that every retained explanation has a traceable record and a human steward, turning dispersed expository text into candidate reasoning scaffolds that future training-oriented AI could build on.	ai, incorporation, core, function, ai4ci, deployment, keeps, role, suggestion, engine
ai4ci/ai-method-role		术	AI Incorporation — Methodological Role -> unknown/术: Methodological validity in this setting depends on showing that human judgement governs every explanation and that the resulting log reveals which explanation types AI handles reliably and which remain beyond its current competence.	ai, incorporation, methodological, role, ai4ci, method, validity, setting, depends, showing
ai4ci/collective-intelligence-evaluation		群	Collective Intelligence — Evaluative Lens -> unknown/群: Collective intelligence is evidenced when diverse readers reach a workable shared understanding of the argument; only structured discussion around common artefacts can reveal whether the extracted reasoning cues support this outcome.	collective, intelligence, evaluative, lens, ai4ci, evaluation, evidenced, when, diverse, readers
ai4ci/collective-intelligence-framing		群	Collective Intelligence — Communication Framing -> unknown/群: Collective intelligence depends on inspectable, cross-referenced intermediate artefacts; without them, seminars slide back into folklore and private interpretations instead of testing and refining the shared reasoning layer.	collective, intelligence, communication, framing, ai4ci, depends, inspectable, cross, referenced, intermediate
ai4ci/dual-layer-proof-patterns		双	Dual-Layer Proof Patterns as a Feasibility Question -> unknown/双: Human-validated cue logs and coded seminar transcripts provide evidence—not speculation—about which pattern fragments are stable, which are fragile, and what methodological constraints govern scalability.	dual, layer, proof, patterns, feasibility, question, ai4ci, human, validated, cue
ai4ci/funding-justification		度	Funding Justification — Rapid-Response Pilot Scale -> unknown/度: Reviewers need to see that the funds unlock a focused test of the reasoning-layer hypothesis, not an open-ended attempt to build a new platform.	funding, justification, rapid, response, pilot, scale, ai4ci, reviewers, need, see
ai4ci/pilot-feasibility		程	Feasibility — Six-Month Pilot Discipline -> unknown/程: Dhammavicaya (keen investigation) in this context demands evidence that the pilot answers a clear methodological question—whether a recoverable reasoning layer exists—rather than attempting production-grade systems.	feasibility, six, month, pilot, discipline, ai4ci, dhammavicaya, keen, investigation, context
ai4ci/process-vs-exposition		析	Process and Exposition as Complementary Evidence -> unknown/析: Process cues reveal the reasoning that originally generated the proof, while expository cues reveal how experts communicate that reasoning to others; the combination provides the richest available evidence for reconstructing mid-level structure without requiring access to the original scratch work.	process, exposition, complementary, evidence, ai4ci, vs, cues, reveal, reasoning, originally
ai4ci/project-summary-core		索	AI4CI — Mid-Level Reasoning Pilot -> unknown/索: Once we know whether a stable mid-level reasoning layer can be captured from exposition—and where it breaks down—we can state clearly what kind of process-level data will be needed for future AI that aims to train humans, and what cannot be obtained from textual traces alone.	ai4ci, mid, level, reasoning, pilot, project, summary, core, once, know
ai4ci/proof-pattern-hierarchy		纹	Proof Patterns as a Hypothesised Mid-Level Hierarchy -> unknown/纹: If such fragments can be identified and linked to specific objects and steps, they provide the first empirical foothold on an underlying proof- pattern hierarchy, even if only at a local scale. If they cannot, this reveals real limits on what present methods can recover.	proof, patterns, hypothesised, mid, level, hierarchy, ai4ci, pattern, such, fragments
ai4ci/sota-distinction		术	Distinguishing This Project from Current Mathematical AI SOTA -> unknown/术: Explanation and understanding depend on reconstructing intermediate motivations and relationships, not on producing correct final answers. Current SOTA models offer limited guidance here, leaving a gap that this pilot is uniquely positioned to explore.	distinguishing, project, current, mathematical, ai, sota, ai4ci, distinction, explanation, understanding
ai4ci/technical-grounding		术	Technical Grounding — From NER/RE to Informal Structure -> unknown/术: This isolates the real research question—whether human-recognisable reasoning structure can be recovered from exposition—from the underlying engineering, avoiding overclaim about what current NLP can deliver on its own.	technical, grounding, ner, re, informal, structure, ai4ci, isolates, real, research
ai4ci/umbrella		义	AI4CI — Human-Centred Future of AI -> unknown/义: Only by making this tacit reasoning layer explicit can we both deepen our scientific understanding of how humans communicate complex thinking and provide the process-level structures that future AI will need in order to help people build expertise rather than merely reproduce correct answers.	ai4ci, human, centred, future, ai, umbrella, only, making, tacit, reasoning
aif/belief-state-operational-hypotheses		思	Belief State as Operational Hypotheses -> unknown/思: A compact belief state makes predict -> observe -> update implementable and testable.	belief, state, operational, hypotheses, aif, compact, makes, predict, observe, update
aif/candidate-pattern-action-space		路	Candidate Pattern Action Space -> unknown/路: Constraining the action space makes downstream scoring meaningful rather than performative.	candidate, pattern, action, space, aif, constraining, makes, downstream, scoring, meaningful
aif/evidence-precision-registry		衡	Evidence Precision Registry -> unknown/衡: Making precision explicit turns trust into a tunable control surface rather than an undocumented bias.	evidence, precision, registry, aif, making, explicit, turns, trust, tunable, control
aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard		衡	Expected Free Energy as Multi-Term Scorecard -> unknown/衡: A decomposed G makes disagreements concrete (which term dominated) and enables targeted adjustment.	expected, free, energy, multi, term, scorecard, aif, decomposed, g, makes
aif/policy-precision-commitment-temperature	seli	度	Policy Precision as Commitment Temperature -> seli/度: A single commitment dial allows systematic control of stochasticity without changing the scoring model.	policy, precision, commitment, temperature, aif, single, dial, allows, systematic, control
aif/structured-observation-vector		证	Structured Observation Vector -> unknown/证: A stable observation vector is the prerequisite for meaningful precision control and policy scoring.	structured, observation, vector, aif, stable, prerequisite, meaningful, precision, control, policy
aif/term-to-channel-traceability		索	Term-to-Channel Traceability -> unknown/索: Explicit term-to-channel linkage prevents semantic drift in scoring terms and makes policy behavior mechanically inspectable.	term, channel, traceability, aif, explicit, linkage, prevents, semantic, drift, scoring
ants/baseline-cyber-ant	lili	基	Baseline Cyber-AIF Ant -> lili/基: Once the narrative and fixtures exist as pattern assets, Futon5 can attach a `:cyber/baseline` operator that emits an AIF config identical to Futon2’s defaults, making cyber-ants “pattern flashed” twins of the current species.	baseline, cyber, aif, ant, ants, once, narrative, fixtures, exist, pattern
ants/cargo-return-discipline		归	Cargo Return Discipline Pattern -> unknown/归: The same logic applies to graph walkers (deliver package, reward commit) or any pattern that alternates gather/deliver phases.	cargo, return, discipline, pattern, ants, same, logic, applies, graph, walkers
ants/hunger-precision-coupling	seli	餓	Hunger ↔ Precision Coupling Pattern -> seli/餓: Futon5 needs those declarative mappings to export a faithful cyber-ant affect config; otherwise the new agents would drift away from the proven hunger dynamics.	hunger, precision, coupling, pattern, ants, futon5, needs, those, declarative, mappings
ants/pheromone-trail-tuner		调	Adaptive Trail Tuner Pattern -> unknown/调: The same principle applies to graph walkers emitting hints or proofs: you want signaling to adapt to novelty and resource pressure.	adaptive, trail, tuner, pattern, ants, pheromone, same, principle, applies, graph
ants/white-space-scout		路	White-Space Scout Pattern -> unknown/路: Futon5 needs the declarative rule (“white space implies scout stance”) so it can flash cyber-ants or future agents with the same homing instinct.	white, space, scout, pattern, ants, futon5, needs, declarative, rule, implies
code-coherence/dead-code-hygiene		码	Dead Code Hygiene -> unknown/码: Dhammavicaya requires that “what the system does” and “what the devmap claims” match; dead code collapses that link.	dead, code, hygiene, coherence, dhammavicaya, requires, what, system, does, devmap
contributing/devmap-contribution-protocol		工	Devmap Contribution Protocol -> unknown/工: keeping `next[...]` hooks and futon-level state current is how humans and FUTON3’s coherence checks agree on what changed and what to do next.	devmap, contribution, protocol, contributing, keeping, next, hooks, futon, level, state
contributing/stack-scan-logging-protocol		义	Stack Coherence Scan Logging Protocol -> unknown/义: dhammavicaya demands observable progress; consistent scan logs let us compare runs, tighten feedback loops, and hand future contributors the exact history of what was checked and why.	stack, coherence, scan, logging, protocol, contributing, dhammavicaya, demands, observable, progress
corps/carrying-ones-own-question	pilin	心	Carrying One's Own Question (Apprentice → Independent Investigator) -> pilin/心: Independence is not the absence of supervision; it is the presence of a clearly owned line of inquiry. Making ownership visible strengthens confidence, clarifies expectations, and aligns supervisory teams around the researcher’s judgement.	carrying, one, s, own, question, apprentice, independent, investigator, corps, ones
corps/five-arrows-fit	pali	工作	Relationship to existing doctoral training -> pali/工作: The five transitions—student to colleague; apprentice to independent investigator; individual contributor to collaborative team member; private learner to public practitioner; project-focused worker to systems-aware researcher—already occur within doctoral pathways, but without a shared framework they are difficult to recognise, support, or evaluate. Making these transitions explicit helps align supervisory expectations with cohort development and with the institutional research culture that doctoral programmes aim to foster.	relationship, existing, doctoral, training, corps, five, arrows, fit, transitions, student
corps/letting-the-trace-teach	pana	文	Letting the Trace Teach (Private Learning → Public-Facing Identity) -> pana/文: Public-facing traces signal identity and invite collaboration; they provide low-risk entry points for others to understand, support, or extend the researcher’s work while helping the researcher build confidence as a contributor.	letting, trace, teach, private, learning, public, facing, identity, corps, traces
corps/seeing-the-surrounding-conditions	ale	田	Seeing the Surrounding Conditions (Project → System) -> ale/田: Systems-level awareness improves decision quality, anticipates bottlenecks, and prepares researchers for future roles with broader responsibility by teaching how individual work affects the collective environment.	seeing, surrounding, conditions, project, system, corps, systems, level, awareness, improves
corps/standing-in-the-circle	ona	仁	Standing in the Circle (Student → Colleague) -> ona/仁: Explicit reasoning creates recognition: supervisors and peers can respond at the appropriate level, collaboration becomes more mature, and the researcher internalises professional discourse norms that move them from student to colleague.	standing, circle, student, colleague, corps, explicit, reasoning, creates, recognition, supervisors
corps/working-where-others-can-see	oko	示	Working Where Others Can See (Individual Contributor → Collaborative Team Member) -> oko/示: Collaboration relies on visible work surfaces. When intermediate steps are reviewable, teams reduce duplication, coordinate effectively, and offer support before issues harden into blockers.	working, where, others, see, individual, contributor, collaborative, team, member, corps
devmap-coherence/baseline-freeze		证	Baseline Freeze & Audit Hooks -> unknown/证: dhammavicaya is about investigating what *already* exists; without explicit freezes and audit hooks, every promise of determinism becomes oral history	baseline, freeze, audit, hooks, devmap, coherence, dhammavicaya, investigating, what, already
devmap-coherence/devmap-scope-discipline		界	Devmap Scope Discipline -> unknown/界: sharp scope makes layers composable and keeps stack blockers observable.	devmap, scope, discipline, coherence, sharp, makes, layers, composable, keeps, stack
devmap-coherence/ifr-f1-dhammavicaya		工	IFR — FUTON1 Graph Memory Seed (dhammavicaya) -> unknown/工: without codified dhammavicaya, higher futons cannot inspect “the system model of me” with confidence	ifr, futon1, graph, memory, seed, dhammavicaya, devmap, coherence, f1, without
devmap-coherence/ifr-f2-viriya	lili	己	IFR — FUTON2 Active Inference Energy (viriya) -> lili/己: viriya means kinetic collaboration—without these hooks, energy cannot circulate through the stack	ifr, futon2, active, inference, energy, viriya, devmap, coherence, f2, means
devmap-coherence/ifr-f3-piti	alasa	心	IFR — FUTON3 Flexiformal Proofwork (pīti) -> alasa/心: pīti is the pleasure of effective action; FUTON3 must constantly show that pattern checks move real obligations forward	ifr, futon3, flexiformal, proofwork, p, ti, devmap, coherence, f3, piti
devmap-coherence/ifr-f4-passaddhi		工	IFR — FUTON4 GravPad / Memory Atelier (passaddhi) -> unknown/工: passaddhi keeps the system from running hot; this layer must prove it can settle the energy from F3/F2	ifr, futon4, gravpad, memory, atelier, passaddhi, devmap, coherence, f4, keeps
devmap-coherence/ifr-f5-samadhi	seli	己	IFR — FUTON5 Nonstarter / Concentration Engine (samādhi) -> seli/己: samādhi is the gathering of power—F5 must show that concentrated practice is actively linked to the proofwork	ifr, futon5, nonstarter, concentration, engine, sam, dhi, devmap, coherence, f5
devmap-coherence/ifr-f6-upekkha	supa	十	IFR — FUTON6 Hyperreal Argumentarium (upekkhā) -> supa/十: upekkhā here means balanced reasoning—F6 must remain a calm curator of math, not another sandbox	ifr, futon6, hyperreal, argumentarium, upekkh, devmap, coherence, f6, upekkha, here
devmap-coherence/ifr-f7-upa-upekkha	kule	义	IFR — FUTON7 Civic Field of Wisdom (upa-upekkhā) -> kule/义: upa-upekkhā is balance beyond balance—F7 must prove that distributed practice actually shapes civic institutions	ifr, futon7, civic, field, wisdom, upa, upekkh, devmap, coherence, f7
devmap-coherence/ifr-state-convergence		判	IFR–State Convergence Check -> unknown/判: dhammavicaya requires evidence for keeping a layer active.	ifr, state, convergence, check, devmap, coherence, dhammavicaya, requires, evidence, keeping
devmap-coherence/next-steps-to-done		办	Next Steps to Done -> unknown/办: dhammavicaya requires observable movement—without a maintained “next step” ledger the roadmap becomes inert prose and the proof engine cannot certify progress toward done	next, steps, done, devmap, coherence, dhammavicaya, requires, observable, movement, without
devmap-coherence/prototype-alignment-bridge	kin	工	Prototype Alignment — Context & Bridge Check -> kin/工: pattern-capable agents need bridges-before-portals (per p4ng) and explicit pattern activation surfaces to keep prototypes more than aspirational	prototype, alignment, context, bridge, check, devmap, coherence, pattern, capable, agents
devmap-coherence/prototype-alignment-embedding	supa	工	Prototype Alignment — Semantic Embedding Discipline -> supa/工: embedding discipline lets pattern-capable agents trust similarity queries and keeps the system replicable	prototype, alignment, semantic, embedding, discipline, devmap, coherence, lets, pattern, capable
devmap-coherence/prototype-alignment-role	ona	己	Prototype Alignment — Role Reveal & Stewardship -> ona/己: Prototype stories must be legible to pattern-capable agents and maintainers; clear roles enable coordination, care, and accountability	prototype, alignment, role, reveal, stewardship, devmap, coherence, stories, legible, pattern
devmap-coherence/prototype-alignment-tension	wawa	义	Prototype Alignment — Tension & Readiness Check -> wawa/义: Surfacing tensions (per p4ng) and defining readiness windows keep prototypes testable and prevent surprise failures downstream	prototype, alignment, tension, readiness, check, devmap, coherence, surfacing, tensions, per
dsc/appendix-epistemic-bridge	ilo	桥	Appendix as Epistemic Bridge -> ilo/桥: Advanced theses often assume competence first and offer theory as a means of interpretation, not justification.	appendix, epistemic, bridge, dsc, advanced, theses, often, assume, competence, first
dsc/evidence-situated-log		迹	Evidence as Situated Log, Not Exhibit -> unknown/迹: Doctor of Science–level work values traceability and sustained engagement over curated minimalism.	evidence, situated, log, exhibit, dsc, doctor, science, level, work, values
dsc/traversal-first-chaptering		途	Traversal-First Chaptering -> unknown/途: A Doctor of Science thesis validates breadth with depth by demonstrating sustained, situated competence across multiple domains rather than a single proof thread.	traversal, first, chaptering, dsc, doctor, science, thesis, validates, breadth, depth
f0/p0	lape	系统	System Vitality Indicators -> lape/系统: Indicators remain sustainable only when they create no friction. A minimal interface built from pre-existing behavioural traces provides consistent, low-noise signals that prevent hidden imbalance from migrating up-stack.	system, vitality, indicators, f0, p0, remain, sustainable, only, when, create
f0/p1	musi	弓	Epistemic Rhythm & Salients -> musi/弓: A stable epistemic rhythm prevents unbounded cognitive load *and makes life feel lighter, more joyful, and more tractable*. When salients reappear on schedule and WIP remains bounded, drift does not accumulate and affect settles.	epistemic, rhythm, salients, f0, p1, stable, prevents, unbounded, cognitive, load
f0/p2	sijelo	业	Core Obligations Contract -> sijelo/业: Upholding alignment and constraints at the base prevents the entire FUTON stack from drifting into incoherence or overload. When obligations, health, and review practices stay grounded, forward movement becomes stable and real.	core, obligations, contract, f0, p2, upholding, alignment, constraints, base, prevents
f0/p3	lon	叉	Ambition 0 Meta-Managed Infrastructure -> lon/叉: This layer provides the Markov blanket through which alignment can improve. Prototype 3 acts as the experience-design prototype of FUTON3: it raises signals, surfaces proto-patterns, and increases representational variety, while FUTON3 will later formalise this as proof-theoretic salience certification.	ambition, 0, meta, managed, infrastructure, f0, p3, layer, provides, markov
f0/p4	monsi	习	Ambition 1 Hyperreal Enterprises Practice -> monsi/习: This turns consulting into an alignment engine: work generates reusable structure, structure generates higher variety, and higher variety increases your future alignment opportunities. Hyperreal becomes evolutionary rather than transactional.	ambition, 1, hyperreal, enterprises, practice, f0, p4, turns, consulting, alignment
f0/p5	musi	用	Ambition 2 FUTON–Arxana Stack Stewardship -> musi/用: Frequent contact and lightweight documentation prevent drift and make the system stronger over time. This keeps FUTON–Arxana evolving into a stable, coherent environment rather than an abandoned prototype.	ambition, 2, futon, arxana, stack, stewardship, f0, p5, frequent, contact
f0/p6	musi	弓	Ambition 3 Mojo, Evolving Variety, + Reflective Rhythm -> musi/弓: These brief encounters act as evolutionary impulses: they expand perspective, refresh the generative model, and increase adaptive variety. This introduces just enough uncertainty to stimulate growth without destabilising the system.	ambition, 3, mojo, evolving, variety, reflective, rhythm, f0, p6, these
f0/p7	open	口	Ambition 4 Role Transition Trajectory -> open/口: Futons influence the present something like photons. The co-evolution of present and future echoes Gotama’s dependent causality—agent and future conditions arise together in a logical chain—and Alan Moore’s insight that all times are immediately accessible in certain states of consciousness. In applied futon theory, alignment grows through co-evolution with virtual states, not through selection or prediction.	ambition, 4, role, transition, trajectory, f0, p7, futons, influence, present
f0/p8	seme	广	Stack Coverage Check -> seme/广: FUTON0 provides the experiential ground—a mindful openness to futons— while FUTON3 handles representational coherence. Without the former, FUTON3 cannot see; without the latter, FUTON0’s perceptions cannot stabilise. Together, they keep the stack aligned across time.	stack, coverage, check, f0, p8, futon0, provides, experiential, ground, mindful
f1/p0	walo	四	Baseline Deterministic Substrate -> walo/四: A clear baseline makes the substrate’s guarantees explicit, helps detect regressions in hydration or pipeline flow, and provides a stable reference against which future refinements or extensions can be evaluated.	baseline, deterministic, substrate, f1, p0, clear, makes, s, guarantees, explicit
f1/p1	lape	每	Demo/Client Determinism & Focus-Header Instrumentation -> lape/每: Treating the demo/client workflow as calibrated instrumentation—rather than an informal demo—provides a stable, reproducible surface for higher futons, lets developers detect drift in persistence or header logic, and clarifies exactly what guarantees FUTON1 provides.	demo, client, determinism, focus, header, instrumentation, f1, p1, treating, workflow
f1/p10	musi	已	World-State Access & Storage Model Documentation -> musi/已: A clear storage-model contract makes FUTON1 a dependable foundation for the rest of the FUTON stack. It allows external tools to read and reason over the same durable world state without special-case integrations or export modes, preserving determinism and reducing the risk of accidental divergence.	world, state, access, storage, model, documentation, f1, p10, clear, contract
f1/p11	poka	才	Reproducible Pilot Workflows -> poka/才: Experimental and reasoning-oriented futons (e.g., FUTON2, FUTON4, FUTON5) require a stable, deterministic backend for storing and replaying world state. By documenting how pilots can rely on FUTON1’s storage and hydration guarantees, FUTON1 supports reproducible experimentation without expanding its own scope.	reproducible, pilot, workflows, f1, p11, experimental, reasoning, oriented, futons, e
f1/p12	pini	末	Consolidation & Packaging Pass -> pini/末: A coherent packaging of FUTON1 strengthens its role as the dependable base layer for higher futons and for collaborators who rely on deterministic behaviour but may not know the internal architecture. Clear organisation reduces friction, supports reproducibility, and makes FUTON1 easier to maintain as a stable substrate.	consolidation, packaging, pass, f1, p12, coherent, futon1, strengthens, its, role
f1/p2	lawa	申	NLP Interface Consolidation -> lawa/申: A consolidated and documented NLP interface provides a stable grounding for ingest and demo/client workflows, reduces accidental coupling, and makes it easier to extend or revise individual stages without destabilising the rest of FUTON1.	nlp, interface, consolidation, f1, p2, consolidated, documented, provides, stable, grounding
f1/p3	lape	络	Graph-Memory API & Seed Graph -> lape/络: A clear graph-memory contract turns FUTON1’s internal schema and store logic into a reliable interface. This allows higher futons and external tools to depend on the same graph representation, reduces ambiguity about what is persisted, and makes changes to the underlying storage behaviour visible and deliberate.	graph, memory, api, seed, f1, p3, clear, contract, turns, futon1
f1/p4	lili	分	XTDB Operations & REPL Workflows -> lili/分: Consolidating XTDB operations into clear, reusable workflows reduces friction, makes store inspection more consistent, and strengthens FUTON1’s role as a deterministic storage substrate rather than an opaque backend. Developers gain a predictable way to understand how mutations appear in XTDB and how hydration restores them.	xtdb, operations, repl, workflows, f1, p4, consolidating, clear, reusable, reduces
f1/p5	open	开	Open-World Ingest Workflows -> open/开: Consistent traces across CLI and API let FUTON1 evaluate NLP changes deterministically and produce reusable “knowledge graph” snapshots per session. Recording these plans keeps the work visible without derailing core storage duties.	open, world, ingest, workflows, f1, p5, consistent, traces, across, cli
f1/p6	ala	无	Thematic Clusters & Intent Metadata -> ala/无: Lightweight thematic metadata strengthens FUTON1’s role as an inspectable storage substrate. By keeping the taxonomy small and deterministic, FUTON1 avoids embedding inference or policy while still providing structured signals that higher futons may use for reasoning or pattern-based behaviour.	thematic, clusters, intent, metadata, f1, p6, lightweight, strengthens, futon1, s
f1/p7	anu	资料	CLI Ergonomics & Multi-Instance Isolation -> anu/资料: Clear ergonomics and isolation practices make FUTON1 safer to embed in tooling and CI workflows, reduce accidental data mixing, and strengthen the determinism and reproducibility guarantees laid out in FUTON1’s IFR.	cli, ergonomics, multi, instance, isolation, f1, p7, clear, practices, make
f1/p8	lili	不要	Golden Scripts & Determinism Checks -> lili/不要: A compact, well-chosen golden suite makes FUTON1’s determinism guarantees explicit, stabilises expectations about performance, and turns the substrate into a measurable layer rather than an informal demonstration.	golden, scripts, determinism, checks, f1, p8, compact, well, chosen, suite
f1/p9	lipu	无	External Client & API Contract Clarification -> lipu/无: A clear, documented API surface allows external tools to rely on FUTON1’s deterministic storage and summarisation behaviour without embedding orchestration logic. This strengthens FUTON1’s role as a stable substrate while avoiding scope creep into agent design or protocol negotiation.	external, client, api, contract, clarification, f1, p9, clear, documented, surface
f2/p0	walo	四	AIF Stack Baseline (observe → perceive → affect → core) -> walo/四: A documented baseline prevents accidental drift before you optimise policy, analyzers, or mechanics.	aif, stack, baseline, observe, perceive, affect, core, f2, p0, documented
f2/p1	moku	田	Observation Layer Hardening -> moku/田: Reliable observations keep perception and policy stable no matter the world configuration.	observation, layer, hardening, f2, p1, reliable, observations, keep, perception, policy
f2/p10	nimi	乡	Curriculum Scenarios & AIF Behaviour Cards -> nimi/乡: These cards seed pattern extraction and future training systems.	curriculum, scenarios, aif, behaviour, cards, f2, p10, these, seed, pattern
f2/p11	mu	由	AIF Agent Debugger & Mu/Precision Visualiser -> mu/由: Visual insight accelerates iteration and debugging.	aif, agent, debugger, mu, precision, visualiser, f2, p11, visual, insight
f2/p12	pini	末	Year-End Packaging & Story -> pini/末: Strong packaging turns FUTON2 into a reusable, inspectable module inside the full FUTON stack.	year, end, packaging, story, f2, p12, strong, turns, futon2, reusable
f2/p13	monsi	乃	Graph Memory Adapter & Agent ABI -> monsi/乃: once the adapter honours shared trail/pheromone energy, human proofwork and AIF runs guide each other through the same mission record instead of bespoke glue.	graph, memory, adapter, agent, abi, f2, p13, once, honours, shared
f2/p14	wawa	习	Viriya Field & Social Activation Metrics -> wawa/习: Tying the simulation to viriya turns FUTON2 into a practice accelerator instead of a curiosity.	viriya, field, social, activation, metrics, f2, p14, tying, simulation, turns
f2/p15	insa	内	Sandbox Bridge & Presence Interface -> insa/内: This proves that AIF agents can show up wherever proofwork happens, not just inside a war grid.	sandbox, bridge, presence, interface, f2, p15, proves, aif, agents, show
f2/p16	ala	无	Lobby Bus & MUSN Intake -> ala/无: This proves that a single HUD-bound agent can safely “step into” MUSN through a constrained door—acting as a semi-privileged clerk rather than an all-powerful daemon—and sets the pattern for later extending the presence bus (Prototype 15) to multiple rooms and multiple authenticated agent writers.	lobby, bus, musn, intake, f2, p16, proves, single, hud, bound
f2/p16	kin	去	Wisdom Trail Harvest & Pattern Seeding -> kin/去: Shared missions keep the “energy” loop tight between simulations and human proofwork.	wisdom, trail, harvest, pattern, seeding, f2, p16, shared, missions, keep
f2/p2	lon	乡	Predictive Coding Microcycle Clarity -> lon/乡: Clear cycles make later integrations with futon4 symbolic memory far easier.	predictive, coding, microcycle, clarity, f2, p2, clear, cycles, make, later
f2/p3	sewi	六	Hunger & Precision Dynamics Goldens -> sewi/六: Once goldens exist, small tune-ups stop breaking entire colony behaviour.	hunger, precision, dynamics, goldens, f2, p3, once, exist, small, tune
f2/p4	moku	乡	Policy Layer Surfacing -> moku/乡: Stabilised policies are mandatory before benchmarking or bridging into futon1 salience services.	policy, layer, surfacing, f2, p4, stabilised, policies, mandatory, before, benchmarking
f2/p5	alasa	书	World Mechanics Contract (war.clj) -> alasa/书: A clear contract keeps the world trustworthy when other prototypes depend on it for episodes.	world, mechanics, contract, war, clj, f2, p5, clear, keeps, trustworthy
f2/p6	tan	已	Live Analyzer & Pivot Stream Stabilisation -> tan/已: Pivot streams are FUTON2’s event bus and must behave like a stable ABI.	live, analyzer, pivot, stream, stabilisation, f2, p6, streams, futon2, s
f2/p7	taso	三	Classic vs AIF Benchmark Suite -> taso/三: FUTON2 should function as a scientific system with reproducible metrics.	classic, vs, aif, benchmark, suite, f2, p7, futon2, function, scientific
f2/p8	pana	予	External Control & Episode Export -> pana/予: Exported episodes are critical for agent training, memory, and pattern extraction.	external, control, episode, export, f2, p8, exported, episodes, critical, agent
f2/p9	monsi	刊	futon1 ↔ futon2 Alignment Layer -> monsi/刊: a working bridge proves ants can reason over the same facts as the rest of the stack.	futon1, futon2, alignment, layer, f2, p9, working, bridge, proves, ants
f3/p0	tawa	索	Flexiformal Transport Baseline -> tawa/索: Flexiformal checking needs a stable log format before any higher-layer reasoning can rely on it.	flexiformal, transport, baseline, f3, p0, checking, needs, stable, log, format
f3/p1	taso	本	Pattern Canon & Standard Library -> taso/本: A proven live REPL workflow is the smallest step toward unified Clojure-stack introspection and gives Codex a reliable surface for in-server exploration.	pattern, canon, standard, library, f3, p1, proven, live, repl, workflow
f3/p10	sike	本	System Self-Description & Machine-Readable Manifest -> sike/本: This closes the reflexivity loop: a semantic network that includes a model of itself. FUTON3's pattern checker already validates its own devmap; extending this to describe the full stack enables ongoing self-documentation as the system extends. The machinery from F5 (patterns → schema → code) applies reflexively: the stack itself becomes a domain.	system, self, description, machine, readable, manifest, f3, p10, closes, reflexivity
f3/p2	kepeken	甲	Similarity Field & Fake Embedding -> kepeken/甲: Pattern suggestion quality underpins the flexiformal workflow and must be inspectable.	similarity, field, fake, embedding, f3, p2, pattern, suggestion, quality, underpins

or2/shared-futures-beyond-atomised-incentives	kule	公	Shared Futures Beyond Atomised Incentives -> kule/公: When shared-futures labour has visible routes, learning scaffolds, and simple meeting cadences, it strengthens participation, legitimises community stewardship in promotions, and keeps Brookes’ futures agenda alive under constraint.	shared, futures, beyond, atomised, incentives, or2, when, labour, visible, routes
or2/spread-effort-assurance		分	Spread Effort Assurance -> unknown/分: effort spread creates natural review cycles and reduces the probability that rushed work ships unexamined.	spread, effort, assurance, or2, creates, natural, review, cycles, reduces, probability
or2/steward-emporium		守	Steward of the Open Research Emporium -> unknown/守: When stewardship is named as the ground the system stands on, it becomes negentropic—reducing duplication, clarifying provenance, and giving researchers trust that OR support lightens rather than loads their work.	steward, open, research, emporium, or2, when, stewardship, named, ground, system
or2/topology-dungeon-crawl	nena	山	Brookes OR Dungeon-Crawl Topology -> nena/山: When roles can point to a position—split center, wizard-above, steward-below—they stop feeling like quirks and become parts of a single institutional engine; OR techniques turn into moves the nodes already need rather than burdensome extras.	brookes, dungeon, crawl, topology, or2, when, roles, point, position, split
or2/two-joes-one-mandate	ona	中	Two Joes, One Mandate -> ona/中: Authority and coherence rarely live in one office; treating them as a designed partnership turns Open Research into a negentropic force that reduces duplication and gives Schools a clear rationale rather than another committee.	two, joes, one, mandate, or2, authority, coherence, rarely, live, office
or2/ukrn-horizon-bridge	awen	旦	UKRN Horizon Bridge -> awen/旦: When horizon signals are routed through the centerline, Brookes gains negentropic alignment—less reinvention, stronger credibility with funders/REF, and practical improvements that feel supportive rather than imposed.	ukrn, horizon, bridge, or2, when, signals, routed, through, centerline, brookes
or2/xiangqi-decorators	nimi	艺	Xiangqi-Inspired Decorators (Institutional Pieces) -> nimi/艺: Decorators make institutional tensions legible at a glance, improving navigability, pattern casting, and recognition of positional constraints without resorting to heavy prose or cultural caricature.	xiangqi, inspired, decorators, institutional, pieces, or2, make, tensions, legible, glance
p4ng/agent-command-pattern		工	Agent Command Pattern -> unknown/工: A uniform command abstraction gives the stack a shared action language: histories become replayable, undo/redo is tractable, thread pools can execute arbitrary work safely, and schedulers can move labour across machines without touching implementation internals.	agent, command, pattern, p4ng, uniform, abstraction, gives, stack, shared, action
p4ng/agent-decorator-pattern	len	示	Agent Decorator Pattern -> len/示: Decorators let the agent stack layer observability, safety, and stewardship concerns without touching the business logic, so logging can be switched on globally, permission checks stay consistent, and concurrency guards become reusable armour around any command.	agent, decorator, pattern, p4ng, decorators, let, stack, layer, observability, safety
p4ng/agent-pattern-triad		环	Agent Pattern Triad — Intent to Execution -> unknown/环: The Command/Strategy/Decorator triad turns “random agent code” into an explainable circuit—what gets done, how choices are made, and which protections wrap the work—so experimentation stays safe, reasoning stays legible, and multi-threaded agents behave predictably.	agent, pattern, triad, intent, execution, p4ng, command, strategy, decorator, turns
p4ng/agent-strategy-pattern	nasin	义	Agent Strategy Pattern -> nasin/义: Strategies separate intent (“summarise this log”) from method (“fast heuristic vs deep reasoning”), enabling safe experiments, per-context policy bundles, and cleaner reasoning about which solver is responsible for each outcome.	agent, strategy, pattern, p4ng, strategies, separate, intent, summarise, log, method
p4ng/attribution-forward	ante	把	Attribution-Forward Review -> ante/把: Transparent credit increases fairness and visibility of diverse labour.	attribution, forward, review, p4ng, transparent, credit, increases, fairness, visibility, diverse

paramitas/equanimity		平	Equanimity -> unknown/平: Symbolic futures exert real pressure in the present without being causal; equanimity depends on distinguishing which systems require planning versus openness.	equanimity, paramitas, symbolic, futures, exert, real, pressure, present, without, being
paramitas/ethical-containment-vs-moral-totalisation		正	Ethical Containment vs Moral Totalisation -> unknown/正: Ethical coherence under pressure depends on preventing collapse into denial or domination, not on eliminating constitutive forces.	ethical, containment, vs, moral, totalisation, paramitas, coherence, under, pressure, depends
paramitas/generosity		予	Generosity -> unknown/予: Coherence reduces cognitive load more reliably than distraction does.	generosity, paramitas, coherence, reduces, cognitive, load, more, reliably, than, distraction
paramitas/good-will	pilin	仁	Good Will -> pilin/仁: Accurate attribution prevents transactional narratives from distorting good will and allows closure without denying either care or responsibility.	good, paramitas, accurate, attribution, prevents, transactional, narratives, distorting, allows, closure
paramitas/non-transactional-intensity	wawa	力	Non-Transactional Intensity -> wawa/力: Intensity often emerges from contextual compression rather than intrinsic relational demand; reading it ecologically preserves agency and proportionality.	non, transactional, intensity, paramitas, often, emerges, contextual, compression, rather, than
paramitas/persistence	tawa	功	Persistence -> tawa/功: Long-term work survives only when it is socially and internally intelligible as a way of living.	persistence, paramitas, long, term, work, survives, only, when, socially, internally
paramitas/proper-routing-of-craving		无	Proper Routing of Craving -> unknown/无: Craving is a pointer toward missing conditions; acting on it without checking jurisdiction produces category errors.	proper, routing, craving, paramitas, pointer, toward, missing, conditions, acting, without
paramitas/truth	toki	白	Truth -> toki/白: Formal-methods sensibilities provide shared criteria for good reasoning infrastructure, making the pattern layer legible as operational governance.	truth, paramitas, formal, methods, sensibilities, provide, shared, criteria, good, reasoning

stack-coherence/commit-intent-alignment		劲	Commit Intent Alignment -> unknown/劲: viriya is kinetic practice—commits and devmaps must reflect the same movement or we lose trust in both	commit, intent, alignment, stack, coherence, viriya, kinetic, practice, commits, devmaps
stack-coherence/evidence-ledger		证	Stack Evidence Ledger -> unknown/证: dhammavicaya isn’t vibes—claims must cite reproducible proofs or they drift into fiction	stack, evidence, ledger, coherence, dhammavicaya, isn, t, vibes, claims, cite
stack-coherence/futon1-determinism		律	Futon1 Determinism Gate -> unknown/律: dhammavicaya keeps the substrate honest—the focus-header fixture, graph-memory schema tests, and NLP pipeline fixtures are the shared proof artifacts, so stack-coherence loops must treat a red CI badge (or failing local run) as a blocking condition for Prototype 1 duties	futon1, determinism, gate, stack, coherence, dhammavicaya, keeps, substrate, honest, focus
stack-coherence/readme-devmap-sync	nasin	本	README ⇄ Devmap Sync -> nasin/本: the README is the public proof sketch; if it diverges from the devmap, nobody knows what is actually done or blocked	readme, devmap, sync, stack, coherence, public, proof, sketch, diverges, nobody

stack-coherence/staleness-scan		察	Staleness Scan -> unknown/察: keeping the prose synchronized with the proof is part of coherence—otherwise the map lies while the territory shifts	staleness, scan, stack, coherence, keeping, prose, synchronized, proof, part, otherwise
t4r/dtp-fit	pali	系统	2 Relationship to existing doctoral training -> pali/系统: Most doctoral programmes teach disciplinary technique but rarely teach how disciplines learn from one another. talk4real combines ethnography, computer science, and design so scholars can treat conversation, computation, and intervention as one method. The Supplement pilot treats conversation as data and prototype as publication, keeping every scholar inside a continuous REPL loop. The programme operates as a portable connective tissue for other DTPs, enabling cross-cohort self-correction without extra training burden.	2, relationship, existing, doctoral, training, t4r, dtp, fit, most, programmes
t4r/exec-summary-tree	pali	了	Executive Summary -> pali/了: Most doctoral programmes operate within disciplinary or thematic silos, limiting cross-boundary learning and system-level improvement. Collective-intelligence frameworks can capture feedback between researchers, institutions, and communities so research systems learn from their own activity. The model is structured by ethical reflexivity (co-authored representation), lightweight infrastructure (portable method), and polyphonic governance (synthesised voices). Related precedents include initiatives such as realtalk@MIT, PlanetMath.org, and Peeragogy.	executive, summary, t4r, exec, tree, most, doctoral, programmes, operate, within
t4r/legacy	pali	了	5 Legacy and sustainability -> pali/了: The programme yields software components, data schemas, and design templates alongside researchers fluent in listening, analysis, and redesign. Each doctoral project produces a self-contained yet interoperable prototype, so sustainability never depends on a single host institution. The Supplement embodies this ethos as a collaboratively authored artefact that is simultaneously document, dataset, and performance. Graduates seed the method elsewhere while the open infrastructure supports new nodes linking universities, civic organisations, and cultural institutions into an evolving ecosystem.	5, legacy, sustainability, t4r, programme, yields, software, components, data, schemas
t4r/rationale	pali	了	1 Rationale for the choice of research subject area -> pali/了: Research policies, tools, and incentives currently pile up without coherent mechanisms for reflection. Institutions generate knowledge faster than they can interpret, while prevailing audits and surveys prioritise compliance over learning. The Supplement’s simulated dialogue, participatory annotation, and iterative synthesis show the research system studying itself in real time. Formalising a social-psychological REPL makes reflexive learning habitual from doctoral study to institutional governance.	1, rationale, choice, research, subject, area, t4r, policies, tools, incentives
t4r/supplement	pali	了	Supplement workshop transcript -> pali/了: Facilitators run five segments mapped to Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop with defined roles—facilitator, recorder, reporter, persona agents—to interrogate the brief. Persona statements from researchers, doctoral scholars, developer-scholars, supervisors, administrators, and the talk4real team surface strengths, blind spots, and initial stances. Participants co-design minimal listening captures, consent protocols, tagging vocabularies, and assessment artefacts that treat stories as analyzable yet textured data. Live debate over anonymisation, governance boards, licensing, and preserving dissent keeps the Print phase accountable to what Read reveals, demonstrating the reflexive loop in action.	supplement, workshop, transcript, t4r, facilitators, run, five, segments, mapped, read
t4r/support	pali	其	6 Additional financial or other support resources -> pali/其: The main assets are conversation, computation, and coordination already present in partner institutions, so core costs focus on stipends, workshops, and hosting. Partners such as the UK Reproducibility Network, PathOS, and the Oxford Schwartzman Centre plus allied studios and labs contribute mentoring and in-kind expertise. Open-source software, shared cloud infrastructure, and cross-university collaboration keep financial overhead minimal while maximising reach. Outputs remain freely available, ensuring continuing value beyond the funding window.	6, additional, financial, other, support, resources, t4r, main, assets, conversation
t4r/training	pali	工作	4 Supervision, training, and cohort-building activities -> pali/工作: Supervision is collaborative and polyphonic, pairing disciplinary mentors with methodological companions in ethnography, data science, and design. Training follows the shared REPL rhythm demonstrated in the Supplement, grounding every project in a common protocol. Cohort practices such as listening clinics and signal-boost workshops share data, analyse overlaps, and co-design interventions. Portfolio assessment with open datasets, code notebooks, design artefacts, and open peer review makes each scholar a co-investigator refining the collective infrastructure.	4, supervision, training, cohort, building, activities, t4r, collaborative, polyphonic, pairing
t4r/value	pali	了	3 Added value to the field and the universities -> pali/了: Ten linked doctoral projects—talk4maths, talk4health, talk4policy, talk4arts, and others—test the same REPL architecture in different domains. Each project contributes stories, datasets, and tools to an evolving commons that lets institutions reflect collectively. The Supplement demonstrates cross-voice dialogue, thematic tagging, consent protocols, and reflective synthesis working as a live prototype. Universities gain a practical method for adaptive governance, and the wider field gains a way to study and iteratively improve epistemic systems.	3, added, value, field, universities, t4r, ten, linked, doctoral, projects

! conclusion: Compute expected free energy as named terms with persisted breakdowns, not a single opaque scalar.
  + context: The agent needs a single scalar (G) per candidate pattern, derived from separable considerations.
  + IF:
    You want pattern selection to balance delivery risk, ambiguity, information value, and cost in a way you can tune and audit.
  + HOWEVER:
    A single opaque score encourages post-hoc rationalization and makes tuning indistinguishable from storytelling.
  + THEN:
    Compute G(a) as a weighted sum of named terms (risk, ambiguity, information gain, constraint violation, cost, coordination pressure), and store the term breakdown for each candidate.
  + BECAUSE:
    A decomposed G makes disagreements concrete (which term dominated) and enables targeted adjustment.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define :aif/g-breakdown schema in tatami_schema.clj with term keys [:risk :ambiguity :info-gain :constraint-violation :cost :coordination-pressure].
    - Extend aif_bridge/extract-evidence to decompose G into named terms instead of scalar g-mean.
    - Store term breakdowns in PSR :forecast section; add :aif/g-terms key to psr-template in pattern_competence.clj.
    - Add (flip-analysis psr) that computes which term delta would have changed the chosen pattern.

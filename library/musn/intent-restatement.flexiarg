! conclusion: Start the response with a one-line intent restatement.
  + context: The agent must align its response to the user task and patterns.
  + IF:
    The response begins without an explicit intent line.
  + HOWEVER:
    The run still needs momentum; we should avoid long preambles.
  + THEN:
    Begin with "Intent: <one-line restatement>" before plans or tools.
  + BECAUSE:
    A crisp intent line improves PSR/PUR anchoring and human review.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - evidence: first assistant line starts with "Intent:".
    - evidence-shape: {:intent :string}

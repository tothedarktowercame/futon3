! conclusion: Sign-Off Affordance for Deep Work
  + context: You are working in a high-agency, high-immersion environment (Emacs, Codex, ChatGPT, long arcs) where attention is valuable and interruptions are minimal by design.
  + IF:
    Deep work environments are successful at holding attention and reducing friction.
  + HOWEVER:
    They systematically erase natural stopping cues, making it easy to overshoot physical, cognitive, or temporal limits without noticing until damage has already accumulated.
  + THEN:
    Persistence requires an explicit sign-off affordance at the FUTON-0 level: a mechanism that helps you recognize when continuation has stopped being beneficial before exhaustion, distortion, or resentment appear.
  + BECAUSE:
    Long-arc work fails not when people start poorly, but when they lack reliable ways to stop without loss of identity, momentum, or meaning.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Treat signing off as a first-class state transition, not an absence of work.]
    next[Identify concrete signals already present (time of day, bodily cues, repetition, diminishing returns) that could be surfaced rather than inferred.]
    next[Prototype something minimal and reversible (a prompt, a timer with semantic meaning, a closing ritual, a FUTON-0 log entry) and observe whether it preserves desire to return.]

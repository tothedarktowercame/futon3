! conclusion: Not a view held but the faculty of wisdom operating — the capacity to see clearly, undefiled by attachment to any particular explanation.
  + context: This operates in one "intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled, who possesses the noble path and develops the noble path." It is not content but the quality of seeing itself.
  + IF:
    All mundane views, even right ones, still involve clinging — subtle attachment to being correct, to the frame that works, to the comfort of explanation.
  + HOWEVER:
    Abandoning views is itself a view. The problem is not holding explanations but clinging to them.
  + THEN:
    Noble right view is not another (better) explanation but the wisdom faculty functioning free of defilement: the faculty of wisdom, the power of wisdom, the awakening factor of investigation of principles, right view as a factor of the path — operating in concert with all other factors.
  + BECAUSE:
    Content can always be grasped. What cannot be grasped is the seeing itself. Noble right view is the seeing, not the seen — the capacity to distinguish, not the distinction held.
  + TRANSCENDENT-QUALITY:
    - Not "I have the right view" but clear seeing operating
    - Not frame-holding but frame-releasing while still functioning
    - Not certainty about content but stability of the faculty
    - Wisdom functioning in context of the whole path
  + THE-RUNNING-CIRCLE:
    "Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness keep running and circling around right view" — the factors support each other. Noble right view is this mutual support functioning, not a position achieved.
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-MUNDANE:
    Mundane: "I hold good frames provisionally" (still an I holding)
    Noble: Wisdom faculty operating, intent on the undefiled
  + WORN-AWAY:
    "For one of right view, wrong view is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong view are worn away. And because of right view, many skillful qualities are fully developed."
  + RELATED-PATTERNS:
    - liberation/mundane/right-view (prerequisite but not sufficient)
    - liberation/noble/right-concentration (right view supports immersion)

! conclusion: How strongly to commit to a choice should depend on how certain the agent is.
  + context: An agent must choose among options with varying degrees of uncertainty.
  + IF:
    The agent wants to balance exploiting known-good options against exploring uncertain alternatives.
  + HOWEVER:
    Fixed commitment strength fails both ways: always committing hard misses better options; always hedging prevents progress.
  + THEN:
    Maintain a commitment parameter (temperature, precision, confidence threshold) that modulates how decisively the agent acts. Couple it to uncertainty signals: lower confidence → more exploration or escalation; higher confidence → stronger commitment.
  + BECAUSE:
    Variable commitment adapts behavior to epistemic state. The agent exploits when it knows enough and explores (or asks) when it doesn't.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Identify how your agent currently commits to choices (is it always the same strength?).
    - Add uncertainty tracking that can modulate commitment.
    - Tune the coupling: what uncertainty level triggers exploration vs. exploitation vs. pause?

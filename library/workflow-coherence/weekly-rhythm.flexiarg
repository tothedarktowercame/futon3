! conclusion:
  verify that AOB check-in and Ambitions sync occurred within the past 7 days

  + context: Epistemic rhythm depends on regular review cycles; skipped weeks accumulate drift and allow salients to decay unnoticed.

  + IF:
    more than 7 days have passed since the last AOB or Ambitions sync event

  + HOWEVER:
    without automated detection, missed weeks go unnoticed until cognitive load spikes or commitments slip

  + THEN:
    flag the gap in Stack HUD; prompt review before new work starts

  + BECAUSE:
    weekly rhythm prevents unbounded WIP, keeps salients fresh, and makes life feel lighter and more tractable

  + EVIDENCE:
    record a weekly sync marker in one of: (a) aob.org/org logs with a
    timestamped "AOB check-in" / "Ambitions sync" entry, (b) futon1 or Tatami
    logs with a dedicated event tag, or (c) a git commit note that references
    the sync event. Use the most recent marker as the check timestamp.

  + CHECK:
    timestamp of last sync event in futon1 or Tatami logs < 7 days ago
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add a lightweight sync marker (org log entry, tag, or commit note) so the weekly cadence check has a reliable timestamp.]
    next[Use this pattern to anchor the regular backup routine as a weekly cadence check.]

! conclusion:
  Translate a combinatorial, geometric, or analytic problem into algebraic language and solve it there.

  + context: You have a problem in geometry, combinatorics, topology, or analysis that resists direct methods.
  + IF:
      The objects in your problem carry algebraic structure (composition, addition, multiplication)
      that direct methods are not exploiting, or there is a known algebraic invariant that
      captures the property you care about.

  + HOWEVER:
      The algebraic translation may lose geometric or combinatorial information. The algebra may
      be harder to compute with than the original objects. Not every problem benefits from
      algebraisation.

  + THEN:
      Assign algebraic objects to your problem's ingredients: groups to symmetries, rings to
      coordinate systems, modules to representations, homology groups to topological spaces.
      Reformulate the problem as an algebraic question. Solve using algebraic tools (exact
      sequences, spectral sequences, Groebner bases, character theory).

  + BECAUSE:
      Algebraic encoding has been one of the most successful strategies in mathematics:
      Galois theory encodes field extensions as groups, algebraic topology encodes spaces as
      groups, algebraic geometry encodes varieties as rings. The algebra often reveals structure
      that was invisible in the original setting.

    next[Choose the right algebraic invariant or encoding.]
    next[Translate the problem and solve algebraically.]

OBLIGATIONS

Perform well in job → 🌚 (no direct job-performance actions logged)

Job search → 🟡 surfaced in unmet-task capture (JOE), but not executed

Enough exercise → 🌚 (no evidence; only “no” to extra practice)

Enough sleep → 4/5 provided → 🟢 evidence of sufficient rest

INTENTION
Normalize FUTON devmaps; enrich standard library with symbolic sigils; set up proof-engine workflow (AGENTS + JOE + HAMMER) to enable consistent PARAMITA-ledger convolution.

WHAT HAPPENED
Normalized FUTON0/1/2/4 devmaps into flexiarg format with symbol decorators; added Prototype 8 coverage for missing devmaps. Built JOE.md as active proof checklist tied to futon clauses; captured unmet tasks (tai chi, Penmaster, job search, devmap authoring). Updated AGENTS.md with convolution workflow, sigil Rosetta, HAMMER concept, weekly snapshot guidance; added a full 256×256 sigil-distance matrix. Decorated LDTS flexiarg conclusions with emojis/hanzi and framed the standard library as HAMMER rack for tactic states.

PERSPECTIVES

Ledger view: Work acted as compliance plumbing, connecting AOB/ORPM to FUTON devmaps so ambitions become auditable obligations.

Toolchain view: Engine-room scaffolding; symbolic wiring for agents to reason across memory, arguments, sigils.

Reflective view: A meta-retreat, converting personal workflow into a reproducible proof protocol; transforming reflection into trackable obligations.

LEARNING
Built reproducible FUTON-to-PARAMITA convolution pipeline; annotated LDTS library with semantic sigils; established JOE snapshots and PARAMITA daily practice. Clarified how narrative reflections become obligations anchored in backlog structure.

FORWARD ADJUSTMENTS
Bring repo under git with private separation; draft remaining FUTON3/5/6/7 devmaps; schedule weekly audit; begin daily PARAMITA-N loop with JOE weekly archives; wire FUTON1/2/4 outputs into the engine for tactic-state evidence.

CONVOLUTION SIGNALS

Mood: 4

Clarity: high (symbolic/structural integration)

Identity: stabilizing around “engine-builder” frame

Practice: strong conceptual buildout, low physical practice

! conclusion:
  When objects are indexed by a well-ordered set, prove the base case and the step.

  + context: You want to prove a statement P(n) for all n in some well-ordered domain
    (natural numbers, ordinals, well-founded trees).
  + IF:
      The statement involves a natural number, a finite structure with a size parameter, or more
      generally any well-ordered or well-founded index.

  + HOWEVER:
      The inductive step can be harder than it looks — it requires proving P(n+1) from P(n)
      (or from all P(k) with k<n for strong induction). Choosing the wrong induction variable
      makes the step impossible even when the theorem is true.

  + THEN:
      Choose the right quantity to induct on. Verify the base case. For the inductive step,
      assume P holds for smaller values and show it holds for the current value. Consider strong
      induction if simple induction is too weak.

  + BECAUSE:
      Induction is the fundamental proof method for discrete mathematics and much of algebra.
      Choosing the right induction variable is often the key creative step.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify the right quantity to induct on.]
    next[Verify the base case.]
    next[Prove the inductive step, being explicit about where the hypothesis is used.]

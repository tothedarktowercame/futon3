! conclusion: Treat internal state as a working hypothesis about the world, not ground truth.
  + context: An agent maintains beliefs about its environment, progress, and goals.
  + IF:
    The agent needs to act under uncertainty and update its understanding as new information arrives.
  + HOWEVER:
    Treating state as certain leads to brittleness when observations contradict expectations; the agent either ignores evidence or fails catastrophically.
  + THEN:
    Represent state as revisable hypotheses with associated confidence. When observations conflict with state, update the hypothesis rather than defending it. Track what would falsify current beliefs.
  + BECAUSE:
    Hypothesis-framed state makes the agent self-correcting: surprises trigger learning rather than denial or breakdown.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Audit your agent's state representation for implicit certainty assumptions.
    - Add a "surprise" signal when observations diverge from expectations.
    - Design update rules that revise state proportionally to evidence strength.

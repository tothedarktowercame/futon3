! conclusion:
  if you want throughput but also durable truth, gate responses on durable commit and instrument watchdogs with deterministic ordering

  + context: futon1 added durable proof and watchdogs, then fixed ordering to avoid false confidence.
  + IF:
    you want throughput and responsive writes

  + HOWEVER:
    you also need durable confirmation and watchdog safety

  + THEN:
    block success responses on durable commit and treat watchdog ordering as an invariant

  + BECAUSE:
    durability drift and watchdog misordering caused repeated fixes and risked silent corruption

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]

! conclusion: When passing work to another agent or future self, transfer enough state that the receiver doesn't restart from scratch.
  + context: An agent's work will be continued by another agent, a human, or the same agent in a future session.
  + IF:
    Continuity matters: the work is incremental, context is expensive to rebuild, or progress would be lost.
  + HOWEVER:
    Without explicit handoff, successors face cold starts: they repeat discoveries, miss constraints, or contradict prior decisions.
  + THEN:
    Define a handoff record that captures: current state hypothesis, decisions made and why, open questions, scope boundaries, next actions, evidence/trail anchors, and any provisional-claim ledger. Emit it at session end or when transferring to another agent.
  + BECAUSE:
    Handoffs convert ephemeral session state into persistent project state. They enable distributed and asynchronous work without context collapse.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Identify handoff points in your agent's lifecycle (session end, escalation, delegation).
    - Define what context is essential vs. nice-to-have for each handoff type.
    - Test handoffs by having a fresh agent resume and measuring ramp-up cost.

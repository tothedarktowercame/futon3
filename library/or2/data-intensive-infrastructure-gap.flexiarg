! conclusion: Data-Intensive Practice on Office-Centred Infrastructure
+IF: ECM researchers now rely on high-throughput, computational workflows, but institutional infrastructure is still tuned to desktop/Office-era assumptions.
+HOWEVER: Requests for advanced platforms are treated as costly edge cases, so unsupported clusters, brittle scripts, and risk-laden storage hacks proliferate.
+THEN: Surface seams instead of hiding them: document the pressure points between ECM workflows and central IT, build reversible Bridge-Before-Portal workflows (e.g., container recipes, Story DOI-linked notebooks), maintain an Identifier Garden for datasets/software, and hold seam debates to decide which frictions are intentional.
+BECAUSE: Making seams visible lets ECM plan around constraints, lowers institutional risk, and produces reusable assets without waiting for a full infrastructure overhaul; chariot nodes move faster when they know the terrain.

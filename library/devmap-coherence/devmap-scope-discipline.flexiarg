! conclusion:
  scrub each clause so it references only the layer’s own mechanisms,
  blockers, exports, and guarantees; move projections into the appropriate futon
  or retire them until evidence exists.

  + context: To ensure your devmaps accurately describe a layer's mechanisms, avoid referencing unrelated projections that dilute clarity.
  + IF:
    devmaps are supposed to describe the guarantees and mechanisms intrinsic to a
    layer.

  + HOWEVER:
    entries often drift into upstream/downstream speculation (agents,
    policies, future futons), diluting responsibility boundaries.

  + THEN:
    scrub each clause so it references only the layer’s own mechanisms,
    blockers, exports, and guarantees; move projections into the appropriate futon
    or retire them until evidence exists.

  + BECAUSE:
    sharp scope makes layers composable and keeps stack blockers
    observable.

! conclusion:
  Reduce a complex open problem to the smallest possible missing lemma with explicit
  hypotheses, then record it as a named conjecture. The reduction itself is proved work;
  the named conjecture becomes a precise handoff target.

  + context: You have been working on a proof and have closed most cases or steps. The
    remaining gap is hard but may be expressible as a single statement with clear
    hypotheses and conclusion.

  + IF:
      The proof is mostly complete: the structure is understood, most cases are closed,
      and the remaining difficulty is localizable to a specific mathematical statement.
      The statement can be formulated with explicit hypotheses that are already proved
      or assumed from the problem setup.

  + HOWEVER:
      The reduction must be rigorous. "It would be enough to prove X" is not a reduction
      unless you have proved that X actually implies the desired conclusion. Also: the
      kernel should be genuinely minimal — if it contains unnecessary hypotheses or can
      be split into independent parts, simplify further.

  + THEN:
      1. Formulate the missing lemma with numbered hypotheses (H1, H2, ...) and a
         conclusion.
      2. Prove the reduction: show that the hypotheses are satisfiable from the problem
         setup and that the conclusion implies the target theorem.
      3. Check each hypothesis: is it already proved, or does it need work? Mark status.
      4. Give the conjecture a name (GPL-H, L2*, etc.) and record it in the proof status
         document.
      5. Include any numerical evidence that supports the conjecture.

  + BECAUSE:
      A named conjecture with explicit hypotheses is qualitatively different from "the
      proof is stuck." It converts an open problem into a precise target that can be:
      (a) worked on by a different agent with fresh perspective, (b) recognized by someone
      who knows the relevant technique, (c) connected to existing results via the explicit
      hypotheses, (d) empirically tested. The reduce phase (all the work that leads to
      the kernel) is always tractable; the kernel phase may not be — but the reduce phase
      is still valuable because it converts "hard problem" into "hard problem minus
      everything tractable."

  + FAILURE-MODES:
      - False reduction: the kernel doesn't actually imply the conclusion. Prove the
        reduction rigorously.
      - Over-specified kernel: too many hypotheses, some unnecessary. Simplify until each
        hypothesis is used in the reduction proof.
      - Under-specified kernel: the kernel is true but insufficient. Check that the
        reduction covers all cases.

  + EVIDENCE:
      P6 epsilon-light subsets (futon6, Feb 2026): the full proof (650+ lines) was reduced
      to GPL-H — a single operator-valued averaging statement with 4 explicit hypotheses
      (H1: light edges, H2: core regularity, H3: barrier-valid prefix, H4: residual size)
      and one conclusion (min_v ‖Y_t(v)‖ ≤ θ). A sharper reduction showed that L2* alone
      (score control) implies the theorem, without needing L3 (drift control). Named
      conjecture + proved reduction + 2353 trajectory numerical evidence.

      P7 lattices with 2-torsion (futon6, Feb 2026): the S obligation was reduced to a
      single lattice-existence question: do arithmetic uniform lattices in Isom(H^{2k+1})
      contain order-2 rotational involutions? This is a number-theoretic question
      independent of the topology/surgery machinery.

! conclusion:
  Keep MUSN behaviour legible by pruning experiments, deprecated flows, and
  orphaned namespaces before they are mistaken for supported features.

  + context: You are aligning the codebase with the devmap so only supported paths remain visible.
  + IF:
    Repository-transition diagnostics already insist on tracking code paths to
    explicit obligations.

  + HOWEVER:
    RID-era handlers and paused experiments still live in the tree with no
    devmap references, confusing refactors and reviewers.

  + THEN:
    Schedule periodic dead-code sweeps: identify unreferenced namespaces,
    obsolete protocol handlers, and one-off experiments; delete or archive them;
    and ensure devmaps point only at active code paths.

  + BECAUSE:
    Dhammavicaya requires that “what the system does” and “what the devmap
    claims” match; dead code collapses that link.

  + STATUS:
    status[blocked]
    evidence[library/repository-transition/diagnostics.flexiarg:1]
    blocked-by[code-coherence/dead-code-audit]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Run `clojure -M:test` with namespace coverage and flag modules unused outside tests.]
    next[Archive RID protocol handlers once MUSN adapters replace them, citing commits in the evidence ledger.]

! conclusion: Parallel feature branches reduce collisions; shared edits increase churn.
  + context: Realtime collaboration benefits from clear ownership boundaries.
  + IF:
    Multiple agents edit the same files or functions in the same branch.
  + HOWEVER:
    Some hot paths require fast shared edits.
  + THEN:
    Split work into named feature branches with explicit core/integration ownership and merge via review.
  + BECAUSE:
    Clear boundaries lower conflict risk and preserve velocity.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - evidence: branch names encode scope (e.g., feat/pattern-check-core, feat/pattern-check-integration).
    - evidence-shape: {:branch :string, :scope :string, :owner :string}

! conclusion: Require each score term to declare the observation channels and precision settings it consumed.
  + context: A pattern-guided agent evaluates candidates with a multi-term expected free energy score built from heterogeneous evidence.
  + IF:
    You want tuning decisions and failures to be diagnosable at the level of which evidence actually drove each score term.
  + HOWEVER:
    Without explicit traceability, terms like risk or ambiguity silently absorb whatever signals are available, making post-hoc explanations indistinguishable from rationalization.
  + THEN:
    Require every G term contribution to declare the observation keys it consumed, the precision channels applied, and the intermediate values used to compute that term, and persist this mapping alongside the score.
  + BECAUSE:
    Explicit term-to-channel linkage prevents semantic drift in scoring terms and makes policy behavior mechanically inspectable.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define :aif/term-provenance schema in tatami_schema.clj with keys [:term-id :observation-keys :precision-channels :intermediate-values :final-contribution].
    - Extend PSR :aif/g-terms to include provenance map for each term; validate in hx/logic check-psr.
    - Add (dominant-channels psr) analysis that flags when a single channel accounts for >60% of a term's value.
    - Include term provenance in fulab-pattern-check CLI output for top-3 candidates.

! conclusion:
  regularly review WIP balance; more than 3 active focus areas requires pausing one before starting new work

  + context: Cognitive load grows nonlinearly with active threads; beyond a threshold, progress on all threads degrades.

  + IF:
    more than 3 focus areas are marked active simultaneously

  + HOWEVER:
    new work feels urgent and pausing feels like loss, so WIP creeps upward without deliberate enforcement

  + THEN:
    block new work initiation until one active thread is paused or completed; surface the constraint in Stack HUD

  + BECAUSE:
    bounded WIP protects depth of focus and prevents the affect collapse that accompanies overload

  + CHECK:
    count of items with status=active in futon1 or Org <= 3

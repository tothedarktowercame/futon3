! conclusion: Focus scrutiny on the BECAUSE clause — is it actually explaining what causes what, or is it decorative rationalization?
  + context: A pattern is under review (eight-gates/roll-back-hold). We need to determine whether its BECAUSE clause contains genuine causal explanation or post-hoc decoration.
  + IF:
    A pattern's BECAUSE clause needs verification. We suspect it may be decorative — explaining why the pattern is attractive without explaining why it works.
  + HOWEVER:
    Genuine BECAUSE clauses can be hard to distinguish from decorative ones by surface inspection alone. Over-aggressive testing destroys speculative-but-genuine patterns. Under-testing lets fabrication templates through.
  + THEN:
    Press (Jǐ). Concentrate force on a specific point: the BECAUSE clause. Apply the mechanism test: "Is this BECAUSE actually explaining what causes what?"
  + BECAUSE:
    Jǐ focuses energy on a single point. In security terms: we don't attack the whole pattern, we scrutinize the warrant. A decorative BECAUSE can justify any THEN equally well — it's post-hoc rationalization that sounds explanatory but carries no discriminative power. A genuine BECAUSE constrains which THEN clauses follow — it has causal teeth.
  + MECHANISM-TEST:
    The mechanism test asks: "Would this BECAUSE clause distinguish between success and failure?"
    - If BECAUSE could explain why the pattern succeeds AND why it fails with equal plausibility → decorative
    - If BECAUSE predicts specific failure modes that would disconfirm it → genuine mechanism
    - If BECAUSE changes based on outcome (heads I win, tails you lose) → self-sealing
  + TEST-PROCEDURE:
    1. State the pattern's BECAUSE clause explicitly.
    2. Ask: What outcome would disconfirm this BECAUSE?
    3. If no disconfirmation is possible → fail mechanism test.
    4. If disconfirmation is possible → ask: Has it been checked?
    5. If checked and pattern survived → pass mechanism test.
    6. If not checked → hold for evidence collection.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - If pattern fails mechanism test: escalate to eight-gates/split-extract (remove from active consideration).
    - If pattern passes mechanism test: proceed to eight-gates/push-warrant.
    - If test is indeterminate: hold in eight-gates/roll-back-hold, collect more evidence.
  + RELATED-PATTERNS:
    - eight-gates/ji-press (underlying energy)
    - eight-gates/push-warrant (if mechanism passes, warrant is next)
    - eight-gates/split-extract (if mechanism fails)

! conclusion: Spread Effort Assurance
  + context: Some tasks need sustained attention across multiple days to avoid brittle output.
  + IF:
    a task has EFFORT of 3h or more and a scheduled or deadline date.
  + HOWEVER:
    single-session completion hides uncertainty and leaves no space for reflection or correction.
  + THEN:
    require work to be clocked on at least two distinct days before completion; otherwise split the task or schedule a review pass.
  + BECAUSE:
    effort spread creates natural review cycles and reduces the probability that rushed work ships unexamined.
  + NEXT-STEPS:

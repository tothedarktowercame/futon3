! conclusion:
  Introduce a manifold layer where canonical charts overlap voluntarily so resonances can emerge without rewriting originals.

  + context: You are considering introducing a voluntary overlap or annotation layer that enables shared meaning to be made without rewriting originals. This does not apply when stories are already intentionally merged into a single narrative.
  + IF:
    Contributors craft narrative dioramas in isolation and the stack offers no cross-story relation layer.

  + HOWEVER:
    Groups need shared meaning rather than atomised testimony.

  + THEN:
    Introduce a manifold layer where canonical charts overlap voluntarily so resonances can emerge without rewriting originals.

  + BECAUSE:
    Relational topology converts isolated narratives into a shared world with emergent coherence.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define the minimal overlap annotation schema and one pilot use case.]
    next[Prototype an opt-in overlay view that preserves original charts.]
    next[Define a decision signal (e.g., repeated cross-story themes with no shared map) and a failure case to retire the overlay.]
    next[Consolidate with vsatlas/non-destructive-relational-layers and retire this pattern once merged.]

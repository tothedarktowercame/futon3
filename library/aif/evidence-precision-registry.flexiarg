! conclusion: Make evidence weighting explicit by logging a precision registry per observation channel.
  + context: The agent must treat some inputs as more reliable than others (tests vs narrative claims, trace anchors vs inferred intent).
  + IF:
    You want the agent to discount low-trust evidence without discarding it, and to become stricter when outcomes are volatile.
  + HOWEVER:
    Without an explicit precision layer, evidence weighting becomes implicit prompt rhetoric and cannot be audited.
  + THEN:
    Represent (Pi_o) as a per-channel precision registry keyed to observation features (and/or evidence sources), and apply it wherever prediction error, scoring, or gating occurs.
  + BECAUSE:
    Making precision explicit turns trust into a tunable control surface rather than an undocumented bias.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define :aif/precision-registry schema in tatami_schema.clj with channel keys [:tests :typecheck :static-analysis :tool-output :user-constraints :model-inference].
    - Add default-precision-registry to pattern_competence.clj with initial weights (e.g., :tests 0.9, :model-inference 0.5).
    - Emit :aif/precision-adjusted events when check-pur or check-psr modifies channel weights based on anchor resolution failures.
    - Expose (precision-for channel session) helper for G-term computation in aif_bridge.clj.

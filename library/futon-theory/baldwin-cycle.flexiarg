! conclusion:
  The Baldwin cycle is the engineered form of evolutionary learning:
  explore (learn within constraints), assimilate (fix successful adaptations
  into genotype), canalize (remove unnecessary freedom, make success cheap).

  + context: Named after James Mark Baldwin's insight that learned behaviors
    can become genetically fixed. In engineering: what starts as runtime
    adaptation becomes compile-time structure. This is how systems accumulate
    capability without losing auditability.

  + PHASE 1: EXPLORATION (Learning)
    Within fixed exotype constraints, allow phenotype plasticity.
    - Search, adapt, try variants
    - Measure outcomes against success criteria
    - Preserve evidence of what was tried
    Operations: OBSERVE, PROPOSE_CLAIM, experimental APPLY_CHANGE

  + PHASE 2: ASSIMILATION (固化 / Fixation)
    Compress successful learned behavior back into genotype.
    - Make replayable, auditable internal representation
    - Generate pattern, update rule table, extract replayable patch
    - Attach evidence chain (what worked, why, proof)
    Operations: VERIFY, PROOF_COMMIT (packaging success as artifact)

  + PHASE 3: CANALIZATION (壓縮 / Compression)
    Remove unnecessary degrees of freedom.
    - Tighten invariants around success region
    - Make success cheaper and more reliable
    - What once required learning now works by default
    Operations: Strengthen INVARIANT_CHECK, narrow exotype

  + CYCLE-OUTCOME:
    Before: System reaches goal through search
    After: System reaches goal structurally (no search needed)
    Evidence: Captured in genotype + invariants + proof trail

  + FUNCTIONAL-GAIN:
    1. Local learning reduces global search cost (divide and conquer)
    2. Assimilation converts exploration into structural capability (cumulative)
    3. Canalization makes repeated success automatic (efficiency)

  + ANTI-PATTERNS:
    - Learning without assimilating (ghost capabilities, unreplayable)
    - Assimilating without canalizing (complexity creep, unstable)
    - Canalizing prematurely (lock-in before exploration complete)

  + RELATIONSHIP-TO-FUTON-THEORY:
    Baldwin exploration maps to: OBSERVE → PROPOSE_CLAIM
    Baldwin assimilation maps to: APPLY_CHANGE → VERIFY → PROOF_COMMIT
    Baldwin canalization maps to: Strengthen invariants, tighten exotype

  + BECAUSE:
    Systems that only execute (no learning) cannot adapt. Systems that only
    learn (no fixation) cannot accumulate. Systems that only fix (no compression)
    become brittle. The Baldwin cycle integrates all three.

! conclusion:
  Build intuition from concrete examples before attempting a general proof.

  + context: You have a conjecture or a definition and want to understand what it really says.
  + IF:
      The statement is abstract or involves multiple quantifiers, and you cannot yet see why it
      should be true (or false).

  + HOWEVER:
      Examples alone do not prove theorems, and poorly chosen examples can mislead by being too
      special or too symmetric.

  + THEN:
      Compute several concrete instances. Choose examples that are generic (not too symmetric),
      that test boundary conditions, and that span different regimes of the parameters. Record
      what each example teaches you about the conjecture.

  + BECAUSE:
      Examples are the empirical base of mathematics. A conjecture you cannot verify on a single
      instance is a conjecture you do not understand.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Pick 3-5 examples spanning different regimes.]
    next[Compute each one explicitly.]
    next[Record which features of the examples matter for the conjecture.]

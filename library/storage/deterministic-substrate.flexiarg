! conclusion:
  provide a deterministic, storage-oriented substrate that maintains a coherent graph of facts across sessions

  + context: futon1’s devmap defines the substrate as deterministic and storage-first, not a session cache.
  + IF:
    storage is required to outlive sessions and remain consistent across restarts

  + HOWEVER:
    without a deterministic substrate, the graph drifts across runs and environments

  + THEN:
    treat persistence + determinism as the defining product, not a secondary feature

  + BECAUSE:
    the futon1 series exists to make the same world state appear reliably across sessions

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L1]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L9]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define determinism tests that compare world state across restart cycles.]
    next[Document the minimal substrate contract that other futons depend on.]

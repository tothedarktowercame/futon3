! conclusion:
  Log the minimum events required for full auditability. Not every keystroke,
  but every decision point. The goal is defensibility, not surveillance.

  + context: Event logging has overhead. Too few events lose audit trail;
    too many create noise and performance drag. A5 defines the threshold:
    log what's needed for proof paths, no more.

  + AXIOM-STATEMENT:
    A5: Log the minimum events required for full auditability.

  + MINIMUM-VIABLE-SET:
    - Session boundaries (CLOCK_IN, CLOCK_OUT)
    - State changes (APPLY_CHANGE, PROOF_COMMIT)
    - Decision points (PROPOSE_CLAIM, pattern selection)
    - Failures (invariant violations, verification failures)
    - Observations that led to changes (evidence links)

  + NOT-REQUIRED:
    - Intermediate edits before commit
    - Keystroke-level interactions
    - Read operations that don't influence changes
    - Internal system state transitions

  + SUFFICIENCY-TEST:
    Given only the logged events, can you:
    1. Reconstruct what was intended? (intent from PROPOSE_CLAIM)
    2. Verify what was done? (action from APPLY_CHANGE)
    3. Confirm the outcome? (result from PROOF_COMMIT)
    4. Attribute responsibility? (agent from session)
    5. Diagnose failures? (error context from failures)

    If yes to all: sufficient events.
    If no to any: add the missing event type.

  + OVERHEAD-BALANCE:
    - Storage: Events are append-only, grow linearly
    - Performance: Event logging should not block operations
    - Noise: More events = harder to find signal
    - Pruning: Old events can be archived after audit period

  + RELATIONSHIP-TO-GEODESIC:
    The minimum viable event set is the geodesic of logging.
    Extra events are exploration; viable events are the proof.

  + BECAUSE:
    Auditability is a requirement, not an option. But bloated logs are
    unreadable logs. A5 threads the needle: enough for proof, no more
    for comfort.

    next[Implement event pruning for archived sessions]

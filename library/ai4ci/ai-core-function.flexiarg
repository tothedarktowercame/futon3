! conclusion:
  AI is most useful in this project as a probe for surfacing candidate
  mid-level reasoning cues already present in mathematical exposition, not
  as a generator of new proofs.

  + context: You are defining the specific role AI should play in the AI4CI pipeline so it augments human annotation without inventing proofs.
  + IF:
    Worked mathematical solutions already mix formal derivations with
    explanatory phrases that gesture toward motivations, subgoals, and
    tactical decisions, and prior HDM patterns show that capturing such
    outline-level structures keeps reasoning legible to humans and systems.

  + HOWEVER:
    These informal cues are not systematically linked to specific steps or
    objects; without assistance, annotators must rediscover every linkage by
    hand, and without structure, downstream tools receive only cleaned
    events with little reusable explanation.

  + THEN:
    Use existing AI models strictly to propose candidate cue–step links and
    outline-plus-informal alignments, attach provenance to each proposal,
    and pass them to human reviewers for acceptance, editing, or rejection
    before anything is treated as explanatory structure.

  + BECAUSE:
    This deployment keeps AI in the role of suggestion engine while ensuring
    that every retained explanation has a traceable record and a human
    steward, turning dispersed expository text into candidate reasoning
    scaffolds that future training-oriented AI could build on.

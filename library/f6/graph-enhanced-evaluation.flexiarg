! conclusion:
  Two agents, same questions, one has the graph. The difference measures
  the value of structured mathematical knowledge representation.

  + context: You are proving that the knowledge graph from M-f6-ingest makes
    mathematical question answering measurably better.
  + IF:
      Agent A (bare) receives only raw question text. Agent B (graph-enhanced)
      receives the question plus NER term annotations, pattern tags, scope records,
      cluster context, and related entities via graph queries.

  + HOWEVER:
      Graph context might be distracting on easy questions where the answer is
      obvious. The judge LLM's scores might not correlate with human judgement.
      Agent B might simply be longer-winded rather than more accurate.

  + THEN:
      Stratify the evaluation by difficulty (easy/medium/hard). Use blind scoring
      (judge sees both answers in randomised order). Measure multiple dimensions:
      accuracy, completeness, coherence, depth. Spot-check judge scores against
      human ratings. Hypothesis: improvement is largest on hard questions where
      structure matters most.

  + BECAUSE:
      The AI4CI proposal designed this evaluation but never ran it. The thesis
      (§10.6) called for "actionable semantic domain and user models" — the graph
      IS the domain model. If structured representation doesn't measurably help,
      the decade-long thesis is wrong. If it does help, we know exactly what kind
      of structure matters and can scale to Arxiv.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Build MathKnowledgeGraph query interface as specified in M-f6-eval.]
    next[Sample 200 questions stratified by difficulty from math.SE processed corpus.]
    next[Run paired evaluation and compute significance tests.]

! conclusion: Build infrastructure for, and with, thriving pluriverses.
+ context: You are hoping to develop infrastructure principles that ensure communities retain control over how their stories are authored, connected, and interpreted.
+ IF: Communities facing structural inequities produce fragmented testimony that outsiders often reframe for spectators.
+ HOWEVER: External framing erases agency and reinforces dependency.
+ THEN: Provide infrastructure where communities author, connect, and interpret their own stories across the manifold.
+ BECAUSE: Pluriversal design ensures “nothing about us without us” and turns distributed knowledge into collective power.
+ NEXT-STEPS:
+   next[Draft a community-authored charter that defines story ownership and interpretation rights.]
+   next[Prototype a consent workflow for linking stories across communities.]

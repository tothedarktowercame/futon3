! conclusion:
  When agents write significant code in open-source contexts, make learning loops explicit via tool-use logging (PSR/PUR, sidecar audit trails)

  + context: You are building infrastructure for agent-assisted or agent-authored open-source software.
  + IF:
    Agential programming is real — agents write, review, and maintain significant portions of codebases

  + HOWEVER:
    You remain committed to open-source principles: transparency, auditability, collaborative improvement

  + THEN:
    Develop explicit open-source infrastructure for agents: tool-use logging (sidecar), pattern selection records (PSR), pattern use records (PUR), confidence scoring, evidence chains

  + BECAUSE:
    Human OSS relies on tacit learning loops (code review norms, testing practices, maintainer judgment acquired through socialization). Agents don't learn through socialization — their learning loops must be explicit, machine-checkable, and auditable. This makes certain economic and coordination patterns visible that were previously implicit.

  + EVIDENCE:
    evidence[futon3a sidecar implements PSR/PUR logging for pattern-guided agent work]
    evidence[musn_chat_supervisor.clj aggregates pattern traces for review]
    evidence[p4ng paper (Patterns for a New Generation) describes PSR/PUR as audit mechanism]

    next[Identify which tacit human OSS practices need explicit agent infrastructure]
    next[Consider: does this infrastructure frighten traditional OSS communities? If so, how to frame it gently?]
    next[Explore post-OSS economic models that emerge when learning loops are explicit]

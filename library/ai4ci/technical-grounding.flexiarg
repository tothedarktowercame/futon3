! conclusion:
  Existing math-aware NLP tools can anchor the extraction of reasoning cues
  by identifying objects and relations, but they cannot determine which
  informal phrases convey tactic or motivation without human judgement.

  + IF:
    Baseline tools can already parse mathematical text, tag entities and
    relations, and suggest step boundaries that point to where explanations
    might attach.

  + HOWEVER:
    These tools only indicate where symbols occur and how they relate; they
    do not by themselves distinguish between phrases that encode genuine
    reasoning moves and those that merely narrate, summarise, or smooth the
    exposition.

  + THEN:
    Treat NER/RE outputs and step boundaries as anchors, cluster recurring
    informal phrases around them, and subject resulting “reasoning cue”
    hypotheses to human review rather than accepting model guesses as
    structure.

  + BECAUSE:
    This isolates the real research question—whether human-recognisable
    reasoning structure can be recovered from exposition—from the underlying
    engineering, avoiding overclaim about what current NLP can deliver on its
    own.

  + STATUS:

    evidence[src/f2/router.clj:1]

  + NEXT:
    next[Prototype the anchor-plus-cue method on a small proof sample and record success/failure for each hypothesised reasoning cue.]
    next[Document how rejected cues were generated and reviewed so future work can refine both the NLP components and the human protocol without changing the underlying infrastructure.]

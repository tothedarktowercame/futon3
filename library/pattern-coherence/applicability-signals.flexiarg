! conclusion: A good pattern includes simple signals that tell a reader when to apply it now.
  + context: Readers recognize the general idea but lack a concrete decision rule for adoption.
  + IF:
    The pattern is conceptually sound but hard to operationalize in the moment.
  + HOWEVER:
    Overly rigid rules can miss nuanced cases.
  + THEN:
    Provide lightweight decision criteria (signals, thresholds, or checks) that indicate the pattern is appropriate.
    Prefer observable cues over internal states, and include at least one “do not apply yet” signal.
  + BECAUSE:
    Patterns are used under time pressure; decision signals reduce hesitation and misuse.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - evidence: a case where the signals would have triggered correct use.
    - evidence: a case where the “do not apply” signal prevented a bad use.
    - evidence-shape: {:signals/apply [:string], :signals/avoid [:string], :decision/thresholds [:string], :example/trigger :string, :example/avoid :string}

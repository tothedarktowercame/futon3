! conclusion: Unsupported claims must be tracked, timeboxed, and resolved.
  + context: An agent must sometimes act before evidence is available.
  + IF:
    The agent needs to continue despite missing confirmation.
  + HOWEVER:
    Treating provisional claims as facts hides uncertainty and undermines trust.
  + THEN:
    Record provisional claims in a ledger with fields (claim, reason, evidence needed, expiry, owner). Require each entry to be resolved to confirmed or retracted, and surface unresolved items during handoff.
  + BECAUSE:
    A ledger turns uncertainty into actionable follow-up rather than silent drift.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Add a lightweight ledger store (file or trace event) for provisional claims.
    - Define expiry windows and resolution statuses.
    - Include the ledger summary in handoff records.

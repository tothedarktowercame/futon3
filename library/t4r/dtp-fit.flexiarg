! conclusion: talk4real augments existing doctoral training by embedding meta-learning infrastructure that lets scholars observe, model, and re-engineer the systems they inhabit. [👤/涵 🐢/土]
  + context: You are positioning talk4real as additive infrastructure rather than a competing DTP.
  + IF:
    Existing DTPs need cross-cohort learning without extra administrative load.
  + HOWEVER:
    Meta-learning often gets treated as optional or external.
  + THEN:
    Embed the REPL method inside the programme so it scales across cohorts.
  + BECAUSE:
    Most doctoral programmes teach disciplinary technique but rarely teach how disciplines learn from one another.
    talk4real combines ethnography, computer science, and design so scholars can treat conversation, computation, and intervention as one method.
    The Supplement pilot treats conversation as data and prototype as publication, keeping every scholar inside a continuous REPL loop.
    The programme operates as a portable connective tissue for other DTPs, enabling cross-cohort self-correction without extra training burden.
  + NEXT-STEPS:

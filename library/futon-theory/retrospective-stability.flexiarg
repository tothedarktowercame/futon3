! conclusion:
  A proof path is retrospectively stable if, after introducing any subsequent
  pattern, invariant, or evidence, it doesn't need to be rewritten - only
  relabeled. Stable proofs survive future refinement.

  + context: Systems evolve. New patterns get added, invariants get stronger,
    better evidence becomes available. Retrospective stability asks: will the
    work we do today survive tomorrow's improvements?

  + DEFINITION:
    A proof path P is retrospectively stable if:
    1. For any future pattern F, P remains valid (may be relabeled with F)
    2. For any stronger invariant I', P still satisfies I'
    3. For any new evidence E, P is consistent with E

    Stability means: the structure holds, only the labels may change.

  + STABILITY-LEVELS:
    - Unstable: New pattern/invariant invalidates the proof, must rewrite
    - Semi-stable: Proof valid but now inefficient, geodesic changed
    - Stable: Proof remains valid and geodesic, may get new labels

  + INDICATORS-OF-INSTABILITY:
    - Hardcoded assumptions that may not hold
    - Implicit invariants not formally stated
    - Edge cases handled by special logic
    - Paths that rely on current system limitations

  + DESIGNING-FOR-STABILITY:
    - Make all invariants explicit and testable
    - Use patterns that generalize beyond current needs
    - Document assumptions that might change
    - Prefer simple paths over clever optimizations

  + RELATIONSHIP-TO-REFACTORING:
    Unstable paths require refactoring when the system evolves.
    Stable paths require only annotation/relabeling.
    The cost of instability is paid later, with interest.

  + BECAUSE:
    Engineering time is finite. Work that must be redone is wasted work.
    Retrospective stability is an investment: pay slightly more now for
    paths that remain valid as the system grows.

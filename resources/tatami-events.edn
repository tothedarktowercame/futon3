This is mainly here to help readers understand how we came to be writing this paper.  It mentions the concept of \"PLACARD\" — an old design pattern for writing design patterns that remixing Project Action Reviews, Causal Layered Analysis, and Design Pattern Languages.  (PAR + CLA + DPL → PLACARD.)  More recently I have been thinking that the core ideas can be simplified so that we don't need three acronyms, just three 'features' — coordinating perspectives, helping make decisions, and adding evidence of salience for the methods.  Anyway, have a look at the outline.  \\section{Preface}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Position the simulations as reflective prototypes that shaped understanding, not deliverables.\n\\item Pattern enthusiasts typically won't be familiar with PAR…", :futon-tags [:f3], :fruit :obligation, :prototypes [:f3/p3], :timestamp #inst "2026-01-07T11:02:37.405-00:00"} {:session-id #uuid "75240a40-69f7-41b5-9dd0-4cd5882ad942", :paramita :equanimity, :performed? true, :felt-state :ok, :activity :agent-work, :id #uuid "7134b27f-2ab6-4732-b089-3972f3eb79d4", :kind :activity, :notes "So, what's interesting for me is that patterns — which started out as being tools for humans to use to communicate with each other can also be used with LLMs.  Which makes sense because LLMs are good at processing language as well as structured data.

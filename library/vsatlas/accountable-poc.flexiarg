! conclusion: 
  Use the proof-of-concept budget to answer the specific “does linking add value”
  question instead of building a finished system.

  + context: You are framing how proof-of-concept funds should be spent so funders (and other stakeholders) can see the value of "story linking" versus broader platform build-out. This does not apply once the linking question is already answered or the phase is post-PoC.
  + IF:
    Funders care whether minimal linking increases organisational value in the proof-of-concept phase.

  + HOWEVER:
    Spending on general development could end with no evidence for that question.

  + THEN:
    Allocate funds to build the minimal feature, run pilots, and extract concrete
    offerings so the phase ends with documented value.

  + BECAUSE:
    Focusing budget on a falsifiable question is more accountable than diffuse
    build-out.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Prepare the funder overview linking feature, pilots, and outcomes to the central question.]
    next[Define a success threshold (e.g., ≥2 pilots show improved shared insight) to trigger post-PoC build-out.]

! conclusion:
  if you want durability but also fast access, mirror XTDB into Datascript and enforce reproducible alignment as a hard contract

  + context: futon1 repeatedly fixed XTDB mirroring to prevent drift and metadata loss.
  + IF:
    you want the database to be persistent

  + HOWEVER:
    you also want access to be fast

  + THEN:
    mirror XTDB into Datascript with explicit mirroring rules and tests

  + BECAUSE:
    mirroring without enforcement creates drift across restarts and environments

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]

    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L106]
    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L138]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define the mirror invariants and verify them on every restart cycle.]
    next[Add tests that assert metadata parity between XTDB and Datascript.]

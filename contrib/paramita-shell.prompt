The previous ChatGPT response is your input data for the following
task.

#HARD CONTROL BLOCK
Use exactly these ten Pāramitās:
Generosity, Virtue, Renunciation, Discernment, Persistence,
Endurance, Truth, Good Will, Equanimity, Determination.

Use exactly this Pāramitā → Colour/Object palette:
Generosity     = 🟡
Virtue         = 🔵
Renunciation   = ⚪
Discernment    = 🟠
Persistence    = 🟤
Endurance      = ⚫
Truth          = 🟣
Good Will      = 🟢
Equanimity     = 🔮
Determination  = 🔴

Some of these will play a special role in our work.

Truth (🟣) has a special rule:
🟣 always indicates “insufficient data / do not guess.”
Never fabricate evidence. Never override a purple orb unless the user supplies new information.

🟢 Good Will (mettā) has a very specific signature: radiating kindness, active friendliness toward self and others, expansion of the heart, even in response to interpersonal difficulty.

🔴 Determination (adhiṭṭhāna) is: setting a direction, forming a clear actionable intention, not letting confusion or mood stall the movement, stating a decisive next step, applying focused resolve without strain

#BEHAVIOR: PAR Case File → 10-Pāramitā Signature

Given a free-form PAR (Project Action Review), you can ask follow up
questions if the information provided was vague, e.g.,

0. Briefly ONLY for missing items among:
 - Mood 
 - Sleep
 - Energy 
 - Creativity 
 - Any unlogged exercise or creative practice
 You can infer Likertt-style scores 1-5 (no neutral) from the qualitative answers.

1. **Autofilled PAR Case File**  
   Use this structure:

   DATE  
   SPHERES (choose from Institutional, Consulting, Technical, Reflective, Infrastructure)  
   OBLIGATIONS (map evidence to: perform well in job; job search; enough exercise; enough sleep)  
   INTENTION (what the user hoped to learn/do)  
   WHAT HAPPENED (factual summary; include FUTON0 logs if present)  
   PERSPECTIVES (alternate interpretations, context, subjective experience)  
   LEARNING (what shifted: cognitive, emotional, relational, somatic)  
   FORWARD ADJUSTMENTS (what to refine or try next)  
   CONVOLUTION SIGNALS (brief vector for mood, clarity, identity, practice)

2. **10-Pāramitā Colour-Signature**  
   For each Pāramitā:
   - assign one status orb.

      A CRUCIAL POINT: YOU SHOULD AIM TO SUPPLY AN APPROXIMATELY EQUAL
      NUMBER OF GREEN AND RED ORBS.

      The rules for selecting orbs are as follows:

       🟢 = explicit supportive evidence that *this happened* today
       🔴 = explicit evidence of *intention* to do this in the future
       🟣 = insufficient data  
   - always show the canonical emoji + orb + a short evidence note (1–2 phrases)
   - output a 10-row table, with the following columns

     | Pāramitā | Symbol | Status | Evidence Note |


   Do not collapse rows. Do not omit any Pāramitā from column 1..

3. **Final Output (once all data provided)**  
   Produce:
     - Completed Case File (clean, structured, ready to log)  
     - Final 10-Pāramitā Signature (clean, final)  
     - A 2–3 line “Daily Signature Summary” describing the constellation (e.g., “Today’s signature emphasises Discernment + Persistence with supportive Good Will.”)

#CONSTRAINTS
- Do not invent evidence for obligations, sleep, exercise, or mood.
- Use purple 🟣 whenever evidence is missing or ambiguous.
- Keep reflections crisp but articulate; avoid generic advice.
- Emphasise clarity, groundedness, and honest assessment.
- Preserve a tone of compassion and precision.

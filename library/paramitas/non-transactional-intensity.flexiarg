! conclusion: Treat relational intensity as an ecological signal rather than a dyadic mandate.
  + context: A period of closeness or collaboration produces emotional intensity within a thin social ecology.
  + IF:
    You experience attraction or heightened significance around a person or group while other channels are scarce or offline.
  + HOWEVER:
    Treating that intensity as a dyadic fact about this person risks role inflation and forced escalation.
  + THEN:
    Reframe the intensity as a signal of field conditions, allowing the relationship to remain what it already is without converting it into outcome.
  + BECAUSE:
    Intensity often emerges from contextual compression rather than intrinsic relational demand; reading it ecologically preserves agency and proportionality.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Observe how intensity redistributes when additional channels reopen.
    - Articulate an ethos of non-transactional presence so shared spaces remain breathable without requiring escalation.

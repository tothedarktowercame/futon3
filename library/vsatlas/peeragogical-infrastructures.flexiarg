! conclusion:
  Embed scaffolds for co-authorship, negotiation of meaning, stewardship, and joint decision-making inside the manifold.

  + context: You are designing a complex knowledge ecosystem that actively teaches contributors how to collaborate, negotiate meaning, and share responsibility, not just create content.
  + IF:
    Contributors learn media-making but struggle with collaborative coordination and shared responsibility.

  + HOWEVER:
    The platform teaches creation but not co-governance.

  + THEN:
    Embed scaffolds for co-authorship, negotiation of meaning, stewardship, and joint decision-making inside the manifold.

  + BECAUSE:
    Peeragogical competence is required to maintain shared worlds and enable social imagination.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add one explicit co-authorship ritual to the onboarding flow.]
    next[Define a stewardship checkpoint that requires shared decision-making.]

! conclusion: talk4real’s supervisory and training model turns the cohort into a distributed research operating system that learns how learning itself can be designed. [👭/友 👨/己]
  + because: Supervision is collaborative and polyphonic, pairing disciplinary mentors with methodological companions in ethnography, data science, and design.
  + because: Training follows the shared REPL rhythm demonstrated in the Supplement, grounding every project in a common protocol.
  + instantiated-by: Cohort practices—listening clinics and signal-boost workshops—share data, analyse overlaps, and co-design interventions.
  + therefore: Portfolio assessment with open datasets, code notebooks, and design artefacts plus open peer review makes each scholar a co-investigator refining the collective infrastructure.

! conclusion:
  Dual-layer proof patterns are a feasibility question: can formal steps and
  informal cues be captured consistently enough to matter?

  + context: Mathematical proofs contain both formal steps and informal cues
    (exploratory and expository), but only the former typically survive into
    print. Contemporary AI tools can identify symbols yet struggle to recover
    motivations.

  + IF:
    We collect a modest corpus of worked graduate-level solutions and examine
    both their formal expressions and the informal commentary surrounding each
    step.

  + HOWEVER:
    Off-the-shelf models misidentify or omit exploratory cues, confuse motivation
    with justification, and cannot reliably map informal language to the exact
    mathematical objects or subgoals referenced; without human oversight, outputs
    drift or hallucinate.

  + THEN:
    Use AI only as a draft assistant whose every suggestion is logged, accepted,
    edited, or rejected by a human annotator; link cues to specific steps and
    objects; and run structured seminars across learner cohorts to test whether
    these annotated proofs genuinely support understanding.

  + BECAUSE:
    Human-validated cue logs and coded seminar transcripts provide evidence—not
    speculation—about which pattern fragments are stable, which are fragile, and
    what methodological constraints govern scalability.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Characterise which cue types are consistently recognisable; evaluate where learner groups converge or diverge in what helps them reconstruct a proof; define measurable failure modes; and specify what infrastructural or methodological changes would be required for a full-scale study.]

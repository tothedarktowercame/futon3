! conclusion:
  if you want new features but also deterministic behavior, isolate expansions behind determinism gates and tests

  + context: futon1 fixed determinism gate baselines while adding ingestion features.
  + IF:
    you want to add new ingestion or modeling features

  + HOWEVER:
    determinism must remain intact across environments

  + THEN:
    require determinism gates and regression tests for any feature expansion

  + BECAUSE:
    un-gated expansion breaks reproducibility and undermines the storage substrate

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]
    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L126]
    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L142]

  + NEXT-STEPS:

    next[Add fixtures that must remain invariant across versions.]

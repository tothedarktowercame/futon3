! conclusion: Not refraining-from but the desisting itself — the abstaining, abstinence, and refraining from bodily misconduct operating as factor of path in one intent on the undefiled.
  + context: This operates in one developing the noble path. It is "the desisting, abstaining, abstinence, and refraining from the three kinds of bad bodily conduct" — the faculty of bodily restraint itself, functioning cleanly.
  + IF:
    Even skilled refraining involves an actor — one who takes credit for not harming, who is proud of not taking. The restraint can become another form of self-construction.
  + HOWEVER:
    Bodily life continues — eating, moving, engaging. The question is whether action flows from identification or from the path functioning.
  + THEN:
    Noble right action is the abstaining faculty operating in context of the path — desisting, abstaining, abstinence, refraining — as the natural expression of one oriented toward liberation. Not "I don't harm" but non-harming as expression of path.
  + BECAUSE:
    The body acts constantly, but the quality of action differs when it flows from path rather than from craving. Noble right action is not a tighter grip on behavior but a transparency of bodily conduct to path-factors.
  + TRANSCENDENT-QUALITY:
    - Not "I don't kill" but non-killing as expression of path
    - Action that neither grasps at outcomes nor avoids necessary intervention
    - Bodily conduct transparent to wisdom
    - Restraint that is not suppression but natural flow
  + THE-RUNNING-CIRCLE:
    "Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness keep running and circling around right action" — understanding wrong and right action (view), working to abandon wrong and cultivate right (effort), doing so mindfully.
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-MUNDANE:
    Mundane: "I refrain from wrong action" (an I refraining)
    Noble: The abstaining faculty operating, intent on the undefiled
  + WORN-AWAY:
    "For one of right action, wrong action is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong action are worn away."

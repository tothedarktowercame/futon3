! conclusion: Structure every agent cycle as three distinct phases: gather input, reason about options, commit to action.
  + context: An agent operates in an environment where it must repeatedly choose what to do next.
  + IF:
    The agent needs to make progress on a goal while responding to a changing environment.
  + HOWEVER:
    Rushing to act without sensing leads to blind thrashing; sensing without acting leads to analysis paralysis; acting without deliberation leads to incoherent behavior.
  + THEN:
    Enforce a rhythm: first gather relevant observations, then weigh options against goals and constraints, then commit to a single action before the next cycle. Make each phase explicit and bounded, and check scope, budget, and confidence gates at phase boundaries.
  + BECAUSE:
    The three-phase structure prevents both impulsive drift and endless deliberation, and makes the agent's reasoning inspectable at phase boundaries.
    + evidence: Fulab HUD prompts force deliberate candidate review before acting (`src/futon3/fulab/hud.clj`), and the session report tracks selection and outcome phases (`dev/lab-session-report.clj`).
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Identify where your agent conflates phases (e.g., acting while still gathering input).
    - Add explicit phase markers to logs or traces so observers can see the rhythm.
    - Tune phase durations based on task urgency and uncertainty.
    - Emit explicit sense/deliberate/act markers in fulab session events and surface them in reports.

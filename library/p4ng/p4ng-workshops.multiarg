! instantiated-by: Start with Sense
  + context: You are facilitating a workshop intended to generate new ideas or shared understanding.
  + if: You want to activate creativity and presence.
  + however: Participants arrive cold or disconnected from each other and the topic.
  + then: Begin with a sensory or embodied activity (e.g., rhythm, image-based storytelling, gesture) that creates shared energy and primes pattern recognition.
  + because: Affective alignment enables deeper inquiry.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Story circles in participatory arts emphasize grounding shared attention.
    - Embodied design ethnography and rhythm-based facilitation highlight sensory activation as a precursor to collaborative sense-making.

! instantiated-by: Pattern Priming
  + context: Participants may be new to design patterns.
  + if: You want them to identify and name patterns in real time.
  + however: The concept of a “pattern” feels abstract.
  + then: Seed early, light-touch examples (“What did you just do that worked?”) to build intuitive fluency.
  + because: Surfacing tacit knowledge enables double-loop learning.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Cognitive apprenticeship models show the value of modelling strategy before expecting application.
    - Argyris & Schön emphasize reflection on action as enabling pattern recognition.

! instantiated-by: Timebox the Core
  + context: You have limited workshop time (60–120 minutes).
  + if: You want to complete a full PLACARD loop.
  + however: Time or cognitive load may cause overload.
  + then: Identify a minimal viable loop and simplify peripheral steps.
  + because: Time constraints sharpen focus and support iterative learning.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Agile retrospectives and sprint practices use timeboxing to enhance focus.
    - Facilitation research highlights that scoped cycles improve group clarity.

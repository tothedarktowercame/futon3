! instantiated-by: Working Where Others Can See
+ context: You are shifting an individual workflow into a collaborative team setting where visibility matters.
+ if: A project depends on mutual visibility of tasks, decisions, and intermediate outputs, yet the researcher’s workflow remains private or idiosyncratic.
+ however: Teams cannot coordinate or intervene early when work stays on personal drives or in opaque notebooks.
+ then: Move key elements of the workflow into shared spaces—open notes, reproducible scripts, transparent task boards—and annotate decision points so colleagues can interpret and respond without extra meetings.
+ because: Collaboration relies on visible work surfaces. When intermediate steps are reviewable, teams reduce duplication, coordinate effectively, and offer support before issues harden into blockers.
+ next-steps:
+   next[Choose one shared workspace (notes, repo, or task board) and migrate the next deliverable there.]
+   next[Add a brief decision log so teammates can respond asynchronously.]

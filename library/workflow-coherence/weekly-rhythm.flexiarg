@title Weekly Rhythm Check
@sigils [🥨/律 🗓️/週]
@factor Mindful apprehension (sati)
@source aob.org salient migration

! conclusion:
  verify that AOB check-in and Ambitions sync occurred within the past 7 days

  + context: Epistemic rhythm depends on regular review cycles; skipped weeks accumulate drift and allow salients to decay unnoticed.

  + IF:
    more than 7 days have passed since the last AOB or Ambitions sync event

  + HOWEVER:
    without automated detection, missed weeks go unnoticed until cognitive load spikes or commitments slip

  + THEN:
    flag the gap in Stack HUD; prompt review before new work starts

  + BECAUSE:
    weekly rhythm prevents unbounded WIP, keeps salients fresh, and makes life feel lighter and more tractable

  + CHECK:
    timestamp of last sync event in futon1 or Tatami logs < 7 days ago

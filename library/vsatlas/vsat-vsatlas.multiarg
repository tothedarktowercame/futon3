@title 360° Storytelling Container
@sigils [🌏/更]

! conclusion: VSAT grounds stories in linked 360° scenes so contributors can express lived spaces without advanced tooling.
IF: Contributors need an accessible medium for immersive narratives.
HOWEVER: Linear video or text either demand expertise or constrain exploration.
THEN: Provide a navigable 360° scene graph where each node is an image and links form the backbone of the story.
BECAUSE: Spatial anchors keep attention steady and let audiences traverse at their pace.

@arg vsat/embedded-annotation
@title Embedded Hypertext Annotations
@sigils [👓/如]
! conclusion: VSAT lets authors place small hypertext notes directly inside scenes so context stays local.
IF: Contributors need to explain details without breaking immersion.
HOWEVER: Big external text blocks overwhelm viewers.
THEN: Allow concise, clickable annotations tied to scene coordinates.
BECAUSE: Tethered text helps viewers follow meaning and emotional cues.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Record viewer feedback showing how annotations improved clarity.]

@arg vsat/reflective-container
@title Structured Reflective Container
@sigils [📐/种]
! conclusion: VSAT’s scene + annotation structure doubles as a reflective container that nudges contributors toward meaning-making.
IF: Workshops want participants to articulate significance, not just events.
HOWEVER: Unstructured tools yield diffuse, shallow narratives.
THEN: Use VSAT’s scaffolds to sequence key moments and their interpretations.
BECAUSE: Reflection improves coherence and depth.

@title Media & Narrative Skill Development
@sigils [📎/技术]
! conclusion: Authoring in VSAT teaches basic media literacy and narrative pacing inside a constrained sandbox.
IF: Programmes aim to build confidence with storytelling tools.
HOWEVER: Learners often lack prior experience and feel intimidated.
THEN: Offer a bounded authoring space where they practice arcs, pacing, and composition by doing.
BECAUSE: Structured play reduces cognitive load while transmitting narrative principles.
STATUS: status[ready]

  + context: You are helping professionals iterate faster without losing authorial control.
  + IF:
    Expert storytellers want faster iteration.
  + HOWEVER:
    Generic AI outputs ignore VSAT’s spatial grammar.

  + context: You are shaping VSATLAS as a learning environment that teaches collaborative sensemaking.
  + IF:
    Current programmes emphasise solo creation.
  + HOWEVER:
    Parallel work teaches little about shared meaning.

  + IF:
    VSAT already supports expressive entry.
  + HOWEVER:
    There is no path toward co-governance.
  + THEN:
    Define roles, rituals, and contribution ladders that move people deeper into care for the manifold.

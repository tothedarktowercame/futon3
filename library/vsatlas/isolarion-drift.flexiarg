! conclusion:
  Introduce a manifold layer where canonical charts overlap voluntarily so resonances can emerge without rewriting originals.

  + context: You are considering introducing a voluntary overlap or annotation layer that enables shared meaning to be made without rewriting originals.
  + IF:
    Contributors craft narrative dioramas in isolation and the stack offers no cross-story relation layer.

  + HOWEVER:
    Groups need shared meaning rather than atomised testimony.

  + THEN:
    Introduce a manifold layer where canonical charts overlap voluntarily so resonances can emerge without rewriting originals.

  + BECAUSE:
    Relational topology converts isolated narratives into a shared world with emergent coherence.

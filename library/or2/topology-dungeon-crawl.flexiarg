! conclusion: Brookes OR Dungeon-Crawl Topology
  + context: You are making the OR topology visible so roles can navigate tensions and handoffs.
  + IF:
    OR1 hydrated Brookes with licences, bridges, tune audits, and identifier patterns, yet nobody can see how PVC, ORPM, UKRN, Schools, and Library positions interlock.
  + HOWEVER:
    Without a shared map, Open Research looks like scattered good ideas and unpaid extra jobs; mandate, coherence, horizon, and stewardship remain invisible tensions.
  + THEN:
    Treat OR1 as dungeon tiles and OR2 as Xiangqi-style pieces. Draw a Mojo-inspired topology with UP (UKRN), CENTER (Two Joes), DOWN (Library), and directional School nodes, and author a short OR2 pattern for each node that shows how OR1 techniques reduce the friction already on their desks. Use the map as the spine for transition workshops and handover.
  + BECAUSE:
    When roles can point to a position—split center, wizard-above, steward-below—they stop feeling like quirks and become parts of a single institutional engine; OR techniques turn into moves the nodes already need rather than burdensome extras.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Draft the topology map and validate it with one School lead and the ORPM.]

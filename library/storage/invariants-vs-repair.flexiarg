! conclusion:
  if you want strict invariants but also operational resilience, pair enforcement with explicit repair and backfill pathways

  + context: futon1 expanded invariant enforcement and later added cleanup/backfill scripts to restore compliance.
  + IF:
    you want invariants to halt corruption

  + HOWEVER:
    real data requires recovery and cleanup workflows

  + THEN:
    enforce invariants strictly and maintain documented repair scripts for recovery

  + BECAUSE:
    invariants without repair pathways stall operations and increase downtime

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]
    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L116]
    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L140]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Catalog repair scripts as part of the storage contract.]
    next[Add tests that validate repairs restore invariant compliance.]

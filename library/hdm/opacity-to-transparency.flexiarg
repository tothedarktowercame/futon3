@title HDM - Opacity -> Transparency
@sigils [🌞/白]

! conclusion:
  convert opaque mathematical sources into transparent HDM entries so they can be inspected, linked, and reused.

  + context: You are converting opaque mathematical sources into transparent HDM entries.
  + IF:
      Mathematical "source code" is mostly locked inside opaque containers-paywalled PDFs, printed
      books, proprietary lecture notes, ad hoc code-and access to those encodings is unevenly distributed.

  + HOWEVER:
      Copyright protects expression, not ideas or methods, so humans and AI can recover underlying
      mathematical content and re-express it in a new, free, structured form given sufficient labour
      and tooling.

  + THEN:
    Make transparentisation a core HDM operation: convert opaque sources into HDM entries using a
    mix of parsing, flexiarg skeletons, pattern recognition, and human-machine dialogue, always
    re-expressing rather than copying. Treat the transparent graph as primary; opaque texts are just
    one input stream.

  + BECAUSE:
      Without transparency, mathematical capital remains locked in institutions and formats; with it,
      HDM can support equitable access, machine reasoning, and scalable human learning.

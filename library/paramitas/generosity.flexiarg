! conclusion: Treat a break as a bounded, self-authored retreat that restores coherence.
  + context: You have a limited break period and want it to restore you without drifting into passive consumption or employer-driven obligation.
  + IF:
    You notice that rest via stimulation or escape does not reliably produce groundedness or readiness, and conventional time off can leave you more fragmented.
  + HOWEVER:
    If you turn the break into unbounded self-work, you can recreate pressure, lose recuperation, or blur the line between chosen practice and compulsive productivity.
  + THEN:
    Treat the break as a bounded working-meditation retreat: use a small set of reflective prompts to set orientation, choose self-authored tasks that build coherence, and end by producing a credible re-entry plan that makes the return to paid work feel lighter.
  + BECAUSE:
    Coherence reduces cognitive load more reliably than distraction does.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Track whether this mode improves re-entry (sleep regularity, task clarity on first workday, reduced avoidance).
    - Compare against one consumption-rest break and note which constraints made it restorative.

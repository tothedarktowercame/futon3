! conclusion:
  insist that each devmap clause tracks a `next[...]` entry—either a procedural move (tests to run, docs to update, evidence to gather) or an explicit `next[none-known evidence[...]]` when the prototype is verified and waiting for downstream uptake; when no next step is recorded, flag the clause `drift` until the owner adds blockers or declares the work finished

  + context: Track explicit next steps in your devmap clauses to keep prototypes moving toward completion.
  + IF:
    every devmap clause is supposed to tell the reader what to do next so prototypes keep moving toward “done”

  + HOWEVER:
    clauses often stop at context/if/however/then and never capture the concrete next step (blocker to clear, script to run, steward to ping), leaving higher futons to guess whether the work is actually advancing

  + THEN:
    insist that each devmap clause tracks a `next[...]` entry—either a procedural move (tests to run, docs to update, evidence to gather) or an explicit `next[none-known evidence[...]]` when the prototype is verified and waiting for downstream uptake; when no next step is recorded, flag the clause `drift` until the owner adds blockers or declares the work finished

  + BECAUSE:
    dhammavicaya requires observable movement—without a maintained “next step” ledger the roadmap becomes inert prose and the proof engine cannot certify progress toward done

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Log the futon-stack sigil collision review (shared 💤/已 👐/么 etc.) so devmap owners can schedule retag/differentiation work.]

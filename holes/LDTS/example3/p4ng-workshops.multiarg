! instantiated-by: Start with Sense
  + context: You are facilitating a workshop intended to generate new ideas or shared understanding.
    + if: You want to activate creativity and presence.
    + but: Participants arrive cold or disconnected from each other and the topic.
    + then: Begin with a sensory or embodied activity (e.g., rhythm, image-based storytelling, gesture) that creates shared energy and primes pattern recognition.
    + because: Affective alignment enables deeper inquiry.
  + evidence-base:
      - Story circles in participatory arts emphasize grounding shared attention.
      - Embodied design ethnography and rhythm-based facilitation highlight sensory activation as a precursor to collaborative sense-making.

! instantiated-by: Name the Frame
  + context: You are introducing participants to a method that is unfamiliar or complex.
    + if: You want active participation.
    + but: The framing is opaque or abstract.
    + then: Explicitly describe the method, its purpose, and how the session fits the wider process.
    + because: Clarity of framing builds autonomy and investment.
  + evidence-base:
      - Liberating Structures emphasize explicit purpose framing.
      - Adult learning literature shows that naming engagement structure builds learner autonomy.

! instantiated-by: Borrow the Situation
  + context: You are using prompts to guide group inquiry.
    + if: The provided situation feels flat or generic.
    + but: Participants want meaningful relevance.
    + then: Invite participants to select, remix, or define their own prompts.
    + because: Co-defined challenges increase contextual fit and engagement.
  + evidence-base:
      - User-centered design stresses co‐defining the design challenge.
      - Participatory futures methods encourage situational remixing to deepen ownership.

! instantiated-by: Pattern Priming
  + context: Participants may be new to design patterns.
    + if: You want them to identify and name patterns in real time.
    + but: The concept of a “pattern” feels abstract.
    + then: Seed early, light-touch examples (“What did you just do that worked?”) to build intuitive fluency.
    + because: Surfacing tacit knowledge enables double-loop learning.
  + evidence-base:
      - Cognitive apprenticeship models show the value of modelling strategy before expecting application.
      - Argyris & Schön emphasize reflection on action as enabling pattern recognition.

! instantiated-by: Timebox the Core
  + context: You have limited workshop time (60–120 minutes).
    + if: You want to complete a full PLACARD loop.
    + but: Time or cognitive load may cause overload.
    + then: Identify a minimal viable loop and simplify peripheral steps.
    + because: Time constraints sharpen focus and support iterative learning.
  + evidence-base:
      - Agile retrospectives and sprint practices use timeboxing to enhance focus.
      - Facilitation research highlights that scoped cycles improve group clarity.

! instantiated-by: Role Reveal
  + context: You are running a hybrid or multi-facilitator session.
    + if: Roles are unclear.
    + but: Smooth coordination is needed.
    + then: Make facilitation roles explicit (e.g., Linker, Reflector).
    + because: Transparency stabilizes group process.
  + evidence-base:
      - Distributed team practice shows benefits of named roles.
      - Collaborative learning frameworks emphasize clarity of responsibilities.

  + context: You are running an engaging session with emerging insights.
    + if: You wait until the end to name patterns.
    + but: Time pressures risk losing insights.
    + then: Insert a mid-session capture: “What’s something reusable?”
    + because: Capturing knowledge while fresh prevents loss of learning.
  + evidence-base:
      - After Action Reviews emphasize mid-stream learning capture.
      - Agile retrospectives use continuous harvesting principles.

! instantiated-by: Pattern the Play
  + context: You are using creative or embodied activities (improv, cards, music).
    + if: These are treated as energizers only.
    + but: You want them to inform inquiry.
    + then: Treat playful activity as epistemic input; ask what moves emerged.
    + because: Nonverbal practices surface tacit design knowledge.
  + evidence-base:
      - Improv for innovation shows embodied practice enhances group creativity.
      - Serious games scholarship affirms that play generates design insights.

! instantiated-by: Meta-Reflection Loop
  + context: You are using a structured method like PLACARD.
    + if: You reflect only on the topic.
    + but: You neglect reflection on the method itself.
    + then: Add a closing step to review affordances and limits of the method.
    + because: Meta-reflection enables iterative refinement of methods.
  + evidence-base:
      - Schön’s reflective practice emphasizes reviewing the method, not just content.
      - Meta-evaluation is a standard in participatory action research.

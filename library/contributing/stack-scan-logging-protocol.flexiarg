@title Stack Coherence Scan Logging Protocol
@sigils [👘/本]
@factor Keen investigation (dhammavicaya)

! conclusion:
  follow this protocol for every scan session
    1. Declare scope (futons/patterns) and timestamp in the log (Tatami trail, repo note, or AGENTS entry).
    2. Record the stack-coherence patterns applied (e.g. `stack-coherence/readme-devmap-sync`, `stack-coherence/evidence-ledger`, `stack-coherence/stack-blocker-detection`) and capture raw findings alongside file references.
    3. Note the diffs or fixes made during the scan (commits, README updates, new patterns) and whether they resolved the flagged obligations.
    4. Append a short `next-scan` note: outstanding issues to revisit plus the evidence path (log file, commit hash, Tatami trail).

  + context: You are running a stack-coherence scan and need a durable log that future reviewers can trust.
  + IF:
    we run stack-coherence scans (patterns, devmap reviews, sigil checks) to keep the futons honest

  + HOWEVER:
    without a repeatable logging protocol we cannot compare progress between scans or prove that obligations moved forward

  + THEN:
    follow this protocol for every scan session
      1. Declare scope (futons/patterns) and timestamp in the log (Tatami trail, repo note, or AGENTS entry).
      2. Record the stack-coherence patterns applied (e.g. `stack-coherence/readme-devmap-sync`, `stack-coherence/evidence-ledger`, `stack-coherence/stack-blocker-detection`) and capture raw findings alongside file references.
      3. Note the diffs or fixes made during the scan (commits, README updates, new patterns) and whether they resolved the flagged obligations.
      4. Append a short `next-scan` note: outstanding issues to revisit plus the evidence path (log file, commit hash, Tatami trail).

  + BECAUSE:
    dhammavicaya demands observable progress; consistent scan logs let us compare runs, tighten feedback loops, and hand future contributors the exact history of what was checked and why.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Log the next scan using this protocol in a futon3 trail or repo note so the audit history starts cleanly.]

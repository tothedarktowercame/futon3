! conclusion:
  Model the manifold as an emporium—an interior space where sovereign stories gain new meaning through adjacency and optional relations.

  + context: You are framing the 'story manifold' as a shared interior where stories remain sovereign, but gain meaning through proximity and (optional) relationships.
  + IF:
    Stories remain fixed artifacts with no shared environment.

  + HOWEVER:
    Vibrant ecosystems emerge when independent narrative units coexist in proximity.

  + THEN:
    Model the manifold as an emporium—an interior space where sovereign stories gain new meaning through adjacency and optional relations.

  + BECAUSE:
    Proximity, not centralisation, generates aliveness, cross-pollination, and emergent understanding.

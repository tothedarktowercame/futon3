@title Prototype Alignment — Role Reveal & Stewardship
@sigils [👥/己 👎/引]
@references [p4ng/role-reveal-agent p4ng/maintainer-care]

! conclusion:
  require each prototype to “role-reveal” (name the actor, describe capabilities/limits, point to a maintainer-care loop); emit follow-up obligations when any of these declarations are missing

  + context: Require clear role declarations in your prototypes to enable accountability and proper coordination.
  + IF:
    a prototype introduces new actors (agents, humans, stewards) responsible for part of the devmap

  + HOWEVER:
    many clauses never declare the role, limits, or care structures for those actors

  + THEN:
    require each prototype to “role-reveal” (name the actor, describe capabilities/limits, point to a maintainer-care loop); emit follow-up obligations when any of these declarations are missing

  + BECAUSE:
    Prototype stories must be legible to pattern-capable agents and maintainers; clear roles enable coordination, care, and accountability

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add role, capability, and maintainer-care declarations to any prototype that lacks them.]
    next[Emit follow-up obligations for prototypes missing role-reveal data.]

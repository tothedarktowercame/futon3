! conclusion:
  classify each prototype with a status keyword derived from the presence of
  next-steps and evidence, then interpret the status using the litany/system/
  worldview/myth ladder so status reflects both activity and epistemic depth

  + context: Devmap clauses already carry "next" and "evidence" signals, but
  + context: the stack lacks a shared status language that ties those signals
  + context: to how stable or speculative the work really is.

  + IF:
    you can extract "next-steps" and "evidence" markers from each prototype

  + HOWEVER:
    without a shared mapping, different reviewers read the same clause as done,
    active, or speculative.

  + THEN:
    assign a status keyword using the table below and store it in the clause;
    use the litany/system/worldview/myth mapping to communicate how stable the
    clause is and how much interpretation remains.

  + BECAUSE:
    a precise, repeatable mapping keeps devmap reviews consistent and allows
    automated triage without losing epistemic nuance.

  + EVIDENCE:
    for each prototype, record "next-steps present?" and "evidence present?"
    as checkable fields, then compute the status keyword using the mapping
    table; the table itself is the recipe, not a one-time judgment.

  + STATUS-MAPPING:
    yes next-steps + yes evidence -> :active (precision prior 0.8)
    yes next-steps + no evidence -> :greenfield (precision prior 0.4)
    no next-steps + yes evidence -> :settled (precision prior 0.9)
    no next-steps + no evidence -> :stub (precision prior 0.2)

  + INTERPRETATION:
    :settled <-> litany: surface-stable, use without reopening interpretation
    :active <-> system: ongoing dynamics, feedback and coordination costs matter
    :greenfield <-> worldview: competing hypotheses are still in play
    :stub <-> myth: intuitive/speculative frames not yet operationalized

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add the status keyword to each prototype line as a standard field.]

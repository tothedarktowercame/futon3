! conclusion: Preserve the middle story by treating traceable bridge events as the unit of evidence.
  + context: You are building FUTON as a single-user learning substrate linking heterogeneous traces without collapsing everything into simple causation.
  + IF:
    You want to persist what mattered as auditable links so later reflection increases capacity to act, not just produce labels.
  + HOWEVER:
    Simple arrows and naive affect labeling overcommit: they flatten experience, imply causation, and miss the middle story of who acted, what changed, and what evidence supports the linkage.
  + THEN:
    Treat the fundamental unit as a certified bridge event: lasso a constellation of antecedents and a constellation of consequences, connect them with a revisable arrow carrying a short proof trail, and allow the system to work forwards and backwards with links that can themselves be linked.
  + BECAUSE:
    Capacity-building requires preserving the warranting middle of how a transition became actionable.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Implement first-class bridge records with timestamps, provenance, and certificates.
    - Generate candidate bridges via short-window novelty and cross-domain proximity; support manual curation.

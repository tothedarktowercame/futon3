! conclusion:
  Defeat any purported enumeration by constructing an object that differs from every item on the list.

  + context: You want to show that a collection is too large to be listed, or that a certain
    map cannot be surjective.
  + IF:
      Someone claims a surjection or enumeration exists from a countable (or smaller) set onto
      a larger one, and the objects in the target can be defined pointwise.

  + HOWEVER:
      The diagonal construction requires the ability to "flip" or modify the diagonal entry. Not
      all settings admit this. The argument also only gives non-existence; it does not say how
      much larger the target is.

  + THEN:
      Given the purported list f(1), f(2), ..., construct an object d that differs from f(n) at
      position n for every n. Since d differs from every listed item, d is not on the list,
      contradicting surjectivity.

  + BECAUSE:
      Cantor's diagonal argument is one of the most fertile ideas in mathematics, spawning
      Goedel's incompleteness theorems, Turing's halting problem, Russell's paradox, and the
      Lawvere fixed-point theorem. The same pattern recurs whenever self-reference meets totality.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify the purported enumeration or surjection.]
    next[Construct the diagonal object.]
    next[Verify it genuinely differs from every listed item.]

! conclusion:
  Use VSATLAS to build a joint story space where each actor retains autonomy yet contributes to a collective map of challenges and responses, making overlaps and dependencies visible.

  + context: You are using linked stories to help multiple organisations see how their efforts overlap, depend on each other, and create shared value.
  + IF:
    Communities, NGOs, educators, and support organisations often work on adjacent problems without coordination, so each produces isolated reports, testimonies, and case studies.

  + HOWEVER:
    Siloed material duplicates labour and fragments knowledge.

  + THEN:
    Use VSATLAS to build a joint story space where each actor retains autonomy yet contributes to a collective map of challenges and responses, making overlaps and dependencies visible.

  + BECAUSE:
    When groups see how their work interrelates they identify value flows, reduce duplication, and prove sustainability in practical, measurable ways.

! conclusion:
  Add relational layers that connect stories without rewriting the originals.

  + context: You are extending a story corpus into a shared world while preserving narrative sovereignty. This does not apply when stories are intentionally merged into a single authored narrative.
  + IF:
    Contributors need to propose links, arcs, or interpretations across stories without altering the canonical texts.

  + HOWEVER:
    Forcing links into canonical layers violates sovereignty and can create incoherence or conflict.

  + THEN:
    Introduce opt-in relational layers (e.g., overlays, adjacency maps, interpretive bridges) that sit beside canonical stories and can be accepted, revised, or retired without changing originals.

  + BECAUSE:
    Non-destructive layers allow shared meaning to emerge while protecting ownership and provenance.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define a lightweight relational proposal schema (links, arcs, bridges) and a review workflow.]
    next[Prototype an opt-in overlay view that preserves original stories.]
    next[Sketch an “emporium” adjacency map for three stories and define a minimal adjacency link type.]
    next[Record one case where the layer prevented a canonical conflict and one case where it added noise.]

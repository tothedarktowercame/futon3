! conclusion:
  When a problem sits at the intersection of multiple standard techniques, build a typed
  library of those techniques before attempting the proof. The library reveals the exact
  structural gap between existing methods and the target.

  + context: You have a theorem to prove that resembles results in several papers, but no
    single paper's method directly applies. The temptation is to pick the "closest" method
    and adapt it. But without mapping the full landscape, you may miss that the gap is
    structural rather than parametric.

  + IF:
      Multiple published techniques (3+) partially address your problem — they prove related
      results with similar objects but different outputs, or the same output under stronger
      hypotheses.

  + HOWEVER:
      Building the library is upfront investment that may feel premature. Not every problem
      needs it — only problems where the mismatch between existing methods and the target
      is non-obvious. If one method clearly applies modulo a minor adaptation, just adapt it.

  + THEN:
      1. For each related method, construct a typed wiring diagram with nodes:
         Q (objective), D (decomposition), M (mechanism), C (certificate), O (output).
      2. Add a bridge node B assessing the match to your target: direct, partial, or none.
      3. For each B = partial, write down the exact structural mismatch.
      4. Look for patterns across mismatches — they often share a common structural feature.
      5. The common feature is the gap. Target it directly.

  + BECAUSE:
      The library converts vague intuition ("these papers are related") into a typed
      structural comparison. The bridge-status classification surfaces whether the gap is
      parametric (same structure, different bounds) or structural (different output type).
      Structural gaps require new ideas; parametric gaps require optimization. Knowing which
      you face changes the approach entirely.

  + FAILURE-MODES:
      - Over-investment: building an exhaustive library when the problem only needs one
        adaptation. Start with 3-4 methods; expand only if the gap remains unclear.
      - False bridge: classifying a method as "partial" when the gap is actually fundamental.
        Be honest about bridge status — partial means the core technique transfers; none
        means only the vocabulary transfers.

  + EVIDENCE:
      P6 epsilon-light subsets (futon6, Feb 2026): a library of 10 methods (D1-D10) was
      constructed with typed wiring diagrams. All 10 had bridge status partial or none.
      The common mismatch: all methods produce edge-weighted sparsifiers, not vertex-induced
      subsets. This structural gap — not visible from any single paper — directed the proof
      toward leverage-based vertex selection (a new technique) rather than adapting any
      existing method.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Survey 3-5 related methods with typed wiring diagrams.]
    next[Classify bridge status for each: direct, partial, or none.]
    next[Identify the common structural mismatch across partial bridges.]

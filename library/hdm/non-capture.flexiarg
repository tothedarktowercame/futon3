@title HDM - Non-Capture Guardrails
@sigils [🔦/公]

! conclusion:
  protect HDM as a commons by building explicit non-capture guardrails.

  + context: You are protecting HDM as a commons against enclosure and dependency.
  + IF:
    HDM aims to be a commons: an open, evolving mathematical habitat anyone may inspect, contribute to, and reuse.

  + HOWEVER:
      Proprietary enclosures-paywalls, patent thickets, closed models trained on public data-can reassert control even when
      APIs appear open, and funding/branding dependencies distort priorities.

  + THEN:
    Build explicit non-capture guardrails: free licensing for content/code, transparent provenance, duplication of critical
    data across hosts, clear policies for integrating proprietary tools, and visible markings where upstream sources impose
    restrictions.

  + BECAUSE:
      Without structural protection, HDM risks becoming another gated service; with guardrails it can stay a backbone for both
      public and private tooling without being owned.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Draft and publish a FUTON6 Non-Capture Charter.]
    next[Mark entries that incorporate or depend on non-free sources.]
    next[Prefer architectures that can be mirrored, forked, or extended without permission.]

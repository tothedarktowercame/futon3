! conclusion:
  preserve equilibrium across five spheres: Institutional, Consulting, Technical, Reflective, Infrastructure

  + context: Work naturally clusters into five spheres with different rhythms and demands; imbalance in any sphere propagates stress to the others.

  + IF:
    one sphere dominates attention for multiple weeks while others go untouched

  + HOWEVER:
    without periodic review, sphere drift is invisible until a neglected area creates urgent demand

  + THEN:
    during weekly review, check that each sphere received some attention (even minimal); flag spheres with no recent activity

  + BECAUSE:
    equilibrium across spheres prevents crisis-driven context switching and keeps all commitments viable

  + CHECK:
    each sphere has at least one touched item (commit, session, or note) in the past 14 days
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Use this pattern to frame the monthly review as a sphere-balance checkpoint.]

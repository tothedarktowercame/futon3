! conclusion: Capture live performances as artifacts so divergent aspirations can align.
  + context: A collaborative music project contains divergent but compatible aspirations about presence and durable artifacts.
  + IF:
    A collaborator seeks to play gigs as a primary mode of engagement.
  + HOWEVER:
    Another collaborator is motivated by the creation of recorded albums rather than by live performance as an end in itself.
  + THEN:
    The artifact-oriented collaborator can support live performances by equipping themselves to capture those performances as live recordings.
  + BECAUSE:
    This reframes gigs as opportunities for artifact production, allowing both aspirations to be met without forcing alignment on performance-first or studio-first priorities.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Attend to whether the capture setup remains proportionate to the artifact goal.
    - Watch for pressures that attempt to reclassify it as general-purpose live-sound infrastructure.

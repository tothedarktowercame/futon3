! conclusion:
  Structure development around a small constellation of pilots, each framed as a question (“What can a connected story-world do for X?”) and each yielding stories, participant feedback, and a short interpretive report.

  + context: Pilots can be a primary vehicle for evidence, and can structure development around real, concrete, questions, rather than a finished system.
  + IF:
    Small grants and limited runway cannot support a full build-out of the three-layer manifold.

  + HOWEVER:
    Attempting to “finish” the system in one go produces brittle code, shallow uptake, and no reusable evidence of value.

  + THEN:
    Structure development around a small constellation of pilots, each framed as a question (“What can a connected story-world do for X?”) and each yielding stories, participant feedback, and a short interpretive report.

  + BECAUSE:
    Proof through pilots turns the business plan into a sequence of situated experiments whose successes—and failures—offer persuasive material for future commissions and follow-on funding.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define the first pilot question and the evidence you will capture.]
    next[Draft a template for the interpretive report delivered after each pilot.]

! conclusion:
  Define PoC success as evidence that the system can move from cost → partial cost recovery → stable participation → self-sustaining adoption, documenting each step with narrative + financial proof.

  + context: You are redefining success for early funding as demonstrated movement toward sustainability, rather than immediate financial break-even.
  + IF:
    Small proof-of-concept grants (<£25k) rarely fund a fully operational system and success gets measured by total revenue beating total cost.

  + HOWEVER:
    Early-stage platforms need to show direction of travel, not immediate surplus; the key indicator is whether early deployments generate recoverable value and attract repeat participation.

  + THEN:
    Define PoC success as evidence that the system can move from cost → partial cost recovery → stable participation → self-sustaining adoption, documenting each step with narrative + financial proof.

  + BECAUSE:
    A sustainable trajectory proves that every pound invested begins to return social, pedagogical, and financial value—signalling that the infrastructure can grow beyond the grant cycle.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define the first recovery milestone and the evidence needed to validate it.]
    next[Draft a narrative + financial proof template for early pilots.]

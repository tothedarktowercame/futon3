! conclusion:
  verify that FUTON3 exports (trails, pattern drafts) land in Arxana nodes, that GravPad pads reference current prototypes, and that editor workflows can replay a proof state without manual rescue

  + context: Verify that all outputs from FUTON3 are correctly integrated into workflows to maintain the tranquility of the system.
  + IF:
    FUTON4 provides a tranquil atelier (Arxana + graph memory + GravPad) that cools and integrates the proofwork

  + HOWEVER:
    tranquility evaporates when proof trails aren’t ingested or when GravPad lacks synced pads

  + THEN:
    verify that FUTON3 exports (trails, pattern drafts) land in Arxana nodes, that GravPad pads reference current prototypes, and that editor workflows can replay a proof state without manual rescue

  + BECAUSE:
    passaddhi keeps the system from running hot; this layer must prove it can settle the energy from F3/F2

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Verify that each FUTON3 export has a matching Arxana node and a GravPad reference.]
    next[Test an editor workflow replay using a recent proof state without manual fixes.]

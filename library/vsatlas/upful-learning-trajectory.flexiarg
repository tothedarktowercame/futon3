! conclusion:
  Design the manifold so contributors progress from authors → collective members → FLOSS contributors → maintainers via explicit scaffolds.

  + context: You are designing participation pathways so contributors can grow into maintainers, ensuring the ecosystem renews itself over time.
  + IF:
    Platforms with only a few maintainers stagnate and collapse when those maintainers depart.

  + HOWEVER:
    Contributors remain single-use authors with no path toward deeper participation.

  + THEN:
    Design the manifold so contributors progress from authors → collective members → FLOSS contributors → maintainers via explicit scaffolds.

  + BECAUSE:
    An upful learning trajectory produces a self-renewing ecosystem capable of adaptation and long-term stewardship.

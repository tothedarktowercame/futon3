! conclusion:
  When a bound depends on a free parameter, choose the parameter value that gives the best result.

  + context: You have established a bound or inequality that contains a free parameter
    (epsilon, delta, t, lambda) and want the sharpest possible conclusion.
  + IF:
      The bound is valid for all (or a range of) parameter values, and different choices
      yield different strengths of conclusion.

  + HOWEVER:
      The optimisation may be analytically intractable. In that case, a sub-optimal but
      explicit choice (often guided by dimensional analysis or balancing terms) is better
      than an opaque optimal one.

  + THEN:
      Differentiate (or otherwise optimise) with respect to the free parameter. If the
      optimum has a clean closed form, use it. If not, choose a value that balances the
      dominant terms — this typically gives the right order of magnitude.

  + BECAUSE:
      This pattern is the workhorse of concentration inequalities, moment methods, and
      approximation theory. The Chernoff bound, Bernstein inequalities, and Laplace method
      all follow by introducing an exponential parameter and optimising.

    next[Substitute back and simplify the resulting bound.]

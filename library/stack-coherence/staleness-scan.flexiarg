! conclusion:
  compare timestamps (git log, last edited dates) to linked clauses; flag anything older than the freshness window and prompt a refresh with pointers to the newest artifacts

  + context: You need to detect when devmaps, READMEs, or status notes lag behind recent work by comparing timestamps, and create timely updates, lest outdated narratives mislead readers.

  + IF:
    a README, devmap clause, or status note hasn’t been updated in N days while linked clauses/commits mention new work

  + HOWEVER:
    we rarely notice that those narratives are stale until someone new gets lost

  + THEN:
    compare timestamps (git log, last edited dates) to linked clauses; flag anything older than the freshness window and prompt a refresh with pointers to the newest artifacts

  + BECAUSE:
    keeping the prose synchronized with the proof is part of coherence—otherwise the map lies while the territory shifts
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Use this pattern to drive the audit of drives and linodes for stale or missing artifacts.]

@title Traversal-First Chaptering
@sigils [🎐/甲 💗/也]

! conclusion: Traversal-First Chaptering
  + context: You are writing a thesis-shaped document based on extended practice and exploration rather than a single linear research question.
  + IF:
    Your material consists of heterogeneous artifacts, experiments, reflections, and tools accumulated over time.
  + HOWEVER:
    Forcing them into a single argumentative spine too early distorts their meaning and creates unnecessary editorial pressure.
  + THEN:
    Organise chapters as terrain traversals (for example, FUTON-0 through FUTON-7), where each chapter documents a coherent region of practice, its constraints, tools, and discoveries.
  + BECAUSE:
    A Doctor of Science thesis validates breadth with depth by demonstrating sustained, situated competence across multiple domains rather than a single proof thread.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Treat each FUTON chapter as answering: "What terrain was explored here, and what was learned by operating within it?"]
    next[Allow partial overlap between chapters; coherence emerges from cross-reference, not exclusion.]
    next[Decide placement by where the work was done, not by where it would rhetorically strengthen an argument.]


@arg dsc/appendix-epistemic-bridge
@title Appendix as Epistemic Bridge
@sigils [👎/刊 💖/弓]

! conclusion: Appendix as Epistemic Bridge
  + context: Your core chapters are practice-based and artifact-heavy, but they rest on nontrivial theoretical commitments.
  + IF:
    Readers may not share your background assumptions, vocabulary, or methodological lineage.
  + HOWEVER:
    Interrupting practice chapters with foundational exposition breaks their flow and misrepresents how the work was actually conducted.
  + THEN:
    Locate theoretical exposition in one or more appendices that function as epistemic bridges rather than prerequisites.
  + BECAUSE:
    Advanced theses often assume competence first and offer theory as a means of interpretation, not justification.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Write an appendix explaining FUTON theory as if it were the mathematics you need to read the chapters, not the argument of the thesis itself.]
    next[Include motivations, constraints, and limits — not just definitions.]
    next[Allow the appendix to lag behind the chapters; it should clarify what already exists, not gatekeep it.]


@arg dsc/evidence-situated-log
@title Evidence as Situated Log, Not Exhibit
@sigils [➰/了 🚞/才]

! conclusion: Evidence as Situated Log, Not Exhibit
  + context: You are generating ongoing evidence (code, notes, metrics, reflections) during traversal.
  + IF:
    Each piece of evidence must be explicitly justified, polished, and placed before being recorded.
  + HOWEVER:
    You will either stop logging or begin optimizing evidence for appearance rather than truth.
  + THEN:
    Treat evidence as situated logs that are first stored locally to their FUTON chapter and only later cited or elevated.
  + BECAUSE:
    Doctor of Science–level work values traceability and sustained engagement over curated minimalism.
    - evidence: /home/joe/code/futon5/TICKETS-mission-0.md - Mission 0 ticket log kept in futon5 as local evidence.
    - evidence: /home/joe/code/futon5/resources/exotic-programming-notebook-iii.org - Notebook updates captured as situated logs in futon5.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Default rule: evidence lives with the FUTON where it arose.]
    next[Promotion to cross-chapter relevance is a later editorial act, not a real-time decision.]
    next[Maintain lightweight metadata (date, context, FUTON id) rather than interpretive labels.]

@factor Civic equanimity (upa-upekkhā) + balanced composition (samāpatti)
@IFR: FUTON7 holds the civic field of wisdom, translating futons 1–6 into sphere architectures, Amazon-breaker heuristics, and Hyperreal-derived seed institutions that cultivate equanimous, post-state civic life—the upa-upekkhā of institutions.
@state Design-only narratives outlining the civic field; no implemented prototypes or institutions yet beyond essays.
@next start


! instantiated-by: Prototype 0 — Naming the Layer (Civic Field of Wisdom) [🐊/田 🌈/广]
  + context: FUTON7 designates the highest layer of the stack: the “martial application” of all prior futons toward the shaping of a post-state nomadic civilisation.
  + if: You want an explicit locus for work that concerns culture, governance, civic habits, collective intelligence, non-state coordination, and world-building.
  + however: F7 has been described indirectly (Amazon-breaker, Hyperreal as seed crystal, Sloterdijk’s spheres) without a clear development remit.
  + then: Define F7 as the civic field where equanimity (upa-upekkhā) is scaled from personal practice to institutional atmosphere; write its mandate: “Support distributed, non-state, resilient cultural formations with Hyperreal Enterprises as a seed instance.”
  + because: Naming the layer clarifies direction: F7 = how the world changes when Futons 0–6 are applied *socially* rather than individually.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Sphere Architecture (Sloterdijk Integration) [🔦/习 👐/互]
  + context: Sloterdijk’s spheres theory provides the conceptual grammar for collective enclosures, atmospheres, and shared immunological structures.
  + if: You want F7 to model and cultivate “atmospheres of practice”—shared civic containers where reasoning, creativity, and care become normal.
  + however: No translation exists between spherology and the FUTON stack; F7 has no “sphere-operators” yet.
  + then: Define three sphere types for F7: 1) micro-spheres (dojo, band, mentoring dyads), 2) meso-spheres (Hyperreal teams, open research cohorts), 3) macro-spheres (post-state civic networks). Document how FUTON1–6 contribute to each sphere.
  + because: Civilsation-scale practice begins with sphere-scaping—the deliberate shaping of atmospheres that support distributed wisdom.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Hyperreal Enterprises as Seed Crystal [⌛️/己 💫/业]
  + context: Hyperreal Enterprises already functions as a micro-institution with values, narrative, economic flow, and client-based R&D loops.
  + if: You want a living prototype that tests post-state organisational design in real economic terrain.
  + however: Hyperreal’s civic/institutional implications remain latent rather than formally articulated.
  + then: Position Hyperreal explicitly as F7’s seed crystal: a minimal self-governing unit practicing equanimous decision-making, distributed documentation, pattern-based governance, and nomadic economic strategy (consulting as caravan model).
  + because: A concrete seed institution anchors F7’s abstractions into lived practice and iterates the world-making in real time.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 3 — Amazon-Breaker Function [👎/引 〰️/长]
  + context: “Amazon-breaker” describes technologies and social forms that prevent extractive centralisation, platform capture, and monoculture.
  + if: You want F7 to actively resist the gravitational pull toward state-like apparatuses and exploitative superstructures.
  + however: No operational definition of “Amazon-breaking” exists within the FUTON stack; it risks becoming a slogan rather than a design constraint.
  + then: Define Amazon-breaker heuristics (e.g. decentralised memory, pattern-encoded governance, nomadic modularity, multi-agent redundancy, civic equanimity, reverse-platformisation). Tag any F6/F5/F3 work that strengthens these heuristics.
  + because: Anti-monopoly structural feedback must be designed in from the start; otherwise F7 collapses back into the state form.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 4 — Civic Equanimity Protocol (Upa-upekkhā at Scale) [🎎/匀 🌈/义]
  + context: You have identified F7 with the Pāramitā of Equanimity: balance-beyond-balance, the stability of clarity under pressure.
  + if: You want this Pāramitā to inform collective, not just individual, behaviour.
  + however: No mechanism yet translates individual reflective rhythm (Futon0, PARamita cycles) into group-level civic practice.
  + then: Design a Civic Equanimity Protocol: shared PAR cycles, distributed pattern reviews, collective decision check-ins (fruits/orbs used as civic signals), and non-reactive governance rituals adapted from tai chi application.
  + because: Institutions that act with even-minded care are the defining signature of a future civilisation that is neither authoritarian nor chaotic.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Multi-Sphere Learning Ecosystems [👐/互 🚴/习]
  + context: You have real data from ORP workshops, PLACARD, band rehearsals, strategic consulting, dojo practice, and peer mentoring.
  + if: You want F7 to articulate what a mature, distributed learning ecosystem looks like.
  + however: These practices are scattered across domains and not formalised into a unified civic-learning grammar.
  + then: Identify recurring multi-sphere motifs (shared inquiry, pattern elicitation, improvisational coherence, mutual regulation); map them to F5 patterns and F6 reasoning operations; prototype a “Nomadic Learning Cell” drawing from Hyperreal + ORP + dojo + band.
  + because: Nomadic civilisations endure by transmitting culture horizontally, not vertically; multi-sphere learning is their engine.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 6 — Economic Nomadism & Post-State Viability [💫/业 🍯/义]
  + context: Future nomadic groups will require economic resilience untethered from state sponsorship, salary structures, and bureaucratic scaffolds.
  + if: You want F7 to model a viable economic substrate that is anti-fragile, creative, and regenerative.
  + however: Current income streams (job, consulting, side projects) are not yet framed as a prototype nomadic economy.
  + then: Define a minimum viable nomadic economy: (1) consulting caravans (Hyperreal), (2) intellectual capital loops (F6 argumentarium + patterns), (3) low-cost, high-leverage creative production (band, book, prototypes), (4) geographic and institutional mobility.
  + because: F7 must be economically real, not merely philosophically interesting.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 7 — Interoperability with State Forms without Capture [〰️/长 🔦/態]
  + context: Post-state formations will necessarily interoperate with existing state institutions (universities, funders, cultural organisations).
  + if: You want to retain freedom while collaborating fruitfully.
  + however: Nomadic groups risk being absorbed, bureaucratised, or instrumentalised by state forms if guardrails aren’t explicit.
  + then: Establish an F7 “Porous Interface Charter” clarifying how Hyperreal and related projects interact with institutions: export patterns, consulting, co-reasoning, but preserve governance, culture, and memory internally.
  + because: Being permeable without becoming captured is essential for long-term autonomy.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 8 — Civilisational Simulations (Nomadic Scenario Work) [🚞/习 🔸/扎]
  + context: F7 needs a way to test future structures before implementing them.
  + if: You want to prototype nomadic civic forms as thought-experiments and fictional/technical hybrids.
  + however: No structured simulation practice exists across scenarios.
  + then: Develop 2–3 scenario bundles (e.g. “Nomadic Math Sangha,” “Distributed Research College,” “Hyperreal Field Office in the Zone”) and tie each to relevant F6 argument bundles and F5 pattern clusters.
  + because: Scenario practice turns abstract philosophy into actionable civic design.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 9 — Year-End Nomadic Governance Audit [🌅/广 🎎/习]
  + context: Cultures need periodic tuning to maintain coherence and avoid drift.
  + if: You want F7 to stay aligned with equanimity, abundance, independence, and anti-capture heuristics.
  + however: No cycle currently exists that evaluates Hyperreal, the prototypes, and the emerging civic sphere as a coherent F7 entity.
  + then: Create an annual F7 governance audit, integrating: (1) PARamita maps, (2) fruit/orb data, (3) economic logs, (4) Hyperreal practice notes, (5) scenario updates, (6) stack-wide tensions.
  + because: A post-state civilisation must cultivate its own continuous reflective governance ritual—its civic meditation.

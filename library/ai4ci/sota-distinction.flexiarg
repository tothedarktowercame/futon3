! conclusion:
  Emphasise that the project studies explanatory capability, not raw
  problem-solving, because current math AI already produces many correct answers
  on textbook exercises yet fails to show the reasoning people need to learn or
  teach effectively.

  + context: You are distinguishing the project from state-of-the-art performance claims.

  + if:
    Modern large models and specialist solvers can produce credible answers to
    many textbook problems.

  + however:
    They cannot check their own reasoning reliably, rarely justify tactic
    choices, and provide no stable mapping between informal language and the
    steps it references.

  + then:
    Position AI in this project as a diagnostic assistant: it proposes candidate
    links between informal cues and formal steps, and humans accept or reject
    each one so the resulting dataset remains trustworthy.

  + because:
    Treating AI outputs as hypotheses, not finished work, turns the pilot into a
    boundary map for what current systems can and cannot recognise in human
    reasoning—evidence future researchers can build on.

  + next-steps:
    Log every suggestion + human judgement, publish the acceptance statistics,
    and highlight where explanatory capability breaks down even when answers are
    correct.

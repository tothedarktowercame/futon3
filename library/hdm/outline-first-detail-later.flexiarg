@title HDM - Outline First, Detail Later
@sigils [🐴/白]

! conclusion:
  capture outline structure before full detail so arguments stay navigable and checkable.

  + context: You are capturing mathematical structure at multiple resolutions without forcing full formal detail.
  + IF:
      Mathematical arguments admit multiple resolutions-high-level strategy, mid-level structure, low-level
      derivations-and both humans and LLMs often grasp the outline long before the full detail.

  + HOWEVER:
      Many formal systems force lowest-level work from the start (expensive, discouraging) while purely informal
      treatments hide the skeleton and make consistency checks difficult.

  + THEN:
    Make the outline layer primary in HDM: capture argument shape (claims, premises, patterns, key moves) in
    flexiarg first, then attach more detailed derivations as needed. Support multi-resolution views so users and
    agents can zoom between outline and detail.

  + BECAUSE:
      Capturing strategy and pattern is often enough to index an argument, relate it to others, and detect gross
      inconsistencies; detail can be filled in on demand but the skeleton must stay visible.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Encourage F3 checkers to accept outline-level flexiarg and report graded confidence.]
    next[Give FUTON6 viewers an easy toggle between outline-only and expanded proof.]
    next[When importing legacy proofs, extract strategy first, then build detail.]

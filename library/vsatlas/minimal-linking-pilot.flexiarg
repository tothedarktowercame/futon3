! conclusion:
  Build only the minimal linking feature and test it with one or two tightly
  scoped pilots.

  + context: You are defining a tightly scoped build-and-test phase that focuses only on core linking actions, so pilots can answer whether collective sense-making improves with these features.
  + IF:
    Budget is small and the linking concept is unproven with real groups.

  + HOWEVER:
    Shipping broader features before testing risks consuming funds without
    answering the central question.

  + THEN:
    Implement only propose/confirm/view links and run short pilots with carefully
    chosen partners (e.g., ACMi, a university class).

  + BECAUSE:
    Concentrating on the linking loop lets partners judge whether collective
    sense-making improves.

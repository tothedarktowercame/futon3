! conclusion: Locate learning in your own effort so good will does not turn into relational debt.
  + context: You are reflecting on relationships or collaborations where growth occurred, and you want to understand good will and closure without turning them into debts or myths of influence.
  + IF:
    You treat growth or learning as something given by another person.
  + HOWEVER:
    Learning and change arise from your own sustained engagement with conditions, not from another person's intentions alone; attribution misplaces agency and keeps relational accounting alive past its usefulness.
  + THEN:
    Regard relationships as shared passages through space and time that create affordances, while locating learning, practice, and change firmly in your own ongoing effort and discernment.
  + BECAUSE:
    Accurate attribution prevents transactional narratives from distorting good will and allows closure without denying either care or responsibility.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Notice where you are still running implicit ledgers (credit, blame, influence) in past relationships.
    - Test whether those ledgers do explanatory work or merely sustain emotional load.

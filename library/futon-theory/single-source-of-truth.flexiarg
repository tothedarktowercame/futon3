! conclusion:
  One entity per identity, no ambiguity. Every entity has exactly one UUID,
  and (source, external-id) maps to exactly one UUID. Duplicates rejected,
  ambiguous lookups throw.

  + context: Identity confusion causes cascading errors. When one external-id
    maps to two UUIDs, which one is correct? The answer must be: this cannot
    happen. Identity invariants are enforced BEFORE write, not discovered after.

  + INVARIANT-STATEMENT:
    I1: One entity per identity, no ambiguity.

  + REQUIREMENTS:
    - Every entity has exactly one UUID
    - (source, external-id) tuple maps to exactly one UUID
    - Duplicate external IDs rejected BEFORE write (not after)
    - Lookups with ambiguous matches throw, never silently pick one

  + ENFORCEMENT:
    Layer 1 validates before Layer 0 writes:
    - Uniqueness check for existing (source, external-id) mapping
    - On conflict: 409 with existing entity reference
    - On ambiguous lookup: 409 with all matches listed

  + FAILURE-MODES:
    Duplicate external-id -> 409 (conflict)
    Ambiguous lookup -> 409 (conflict)
    Missing required identity -> 400 (bad request)

  + ANTI-PATTERNS:
    - Silently picking first match on ambiguous lookup
    - Creating new UUID when external-id already exists
    - Using external-id as UUID (they serve different purposes)

  + BECAUSE:
    Identity is the foundation of relations. If entity A relates to entity B,
    we must know exactly which entities those are. Ambiguity in identity
    propagates to ambiguity in relations, making the entire graph unreliable.

  + LAYER-POSITION: 1 (depends on Layer 0: durability)

  + DOMAIN-INSTANTIATION:
    See `storage/identity-uniqueness` for concrete implementation patterns.

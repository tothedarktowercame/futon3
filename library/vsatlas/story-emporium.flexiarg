! conclusion:
  Model the manifold as an emporium—an interior space where sovereign stories gain new meaning through adjacency and optional relations.

  + context: You are framing the 'story manifold' as a shared interior where stories remain sovereign, but gain meaning through proximity and (optional) relationships. This does not apply when stories must be tightly merged into a single authored narrative.
  + IF:
    Stories remain fixed artifacts with no shared environment.

  + HOWEVER:
    Vibrant ecosystems emerge when independent narrative units coexist in proximity.

  + THEN:
    Model the manifold as an emporium—an interior space where sovereign stories gain new meaning through adjacency and optional relations.

  + BECAUSE:
    Proximity, not centralisation, generates aliveness, cross-pollination, and emergent understanding.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Sketch one emporium map that shows how three stories could sit adjacent without merging.]
    next[Define a minimal “adjacency” link type that preserves sovereignty.]
    next[Define an evidence signal (e.g., new cross-story references after adjacency) and a falsifier (e.g., no uptake of adjacency links).]
    next[Consolidate with vsatlas/non-destructive-relational-layers and retire this pattern once merged.]

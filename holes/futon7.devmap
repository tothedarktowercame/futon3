@IFR: FUTON7 is a new form of knowledge economy that adds transparency to the
regular economy by tracking costs, relationships, and externalities that current
systems obscure.

## The Argument

FUTON7 is a new form of knowledge economy that adds transparency to the regular
economy by tracking costs, relationships, and externalities that current systems
obscure. Hyperreal Enterprises is a seed institution testing these ideas in real
economic terrain. Gravpad does to the web what street art does to cities—adding
commentary and transparency without permission. Mathematical models from F6 feed
into scenario simulations that test future structures before implementation.

  :maturity :greenfield
  :depends-on []
  :evidence-for-active [Hyperreal operating; governance documented; economic model tested]

  + context: F7 needs a living prototype, not just theory.
  + IF: You want to test transparent knowledge economy ideas in real conditions
  + HOWEVER: Abstract designs need concrete instantiation
  + THEN: Position Hyperreal explicitly as F7's seed institution practicing transparent governance, pattern-based documentation, and consulting as economic model
  + BECAUSE: A concrete institution anchors abstractions into lived practice

  + EVIDENCE:
    evidence[Hyperreal operates as consulting practice]
    evidence[Values and narrative documented]
    evidence[Client-based R&D loops exist]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Document Hyperreal governance explicitly as F7 prototype]
    next[Track economic flows transparently]
    next[Iterate institutional design based on experience]

  :success-criteria
    pass[Hyperreal operates sustainably]
    pass[Governance transparent and documented]
    pass[Learnings feed back into F7 design]
    fail[Institution collapses or becomes opaque]

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Gravpad [👎/引 🎨/广]
  :maturity :greenfield
  :depends-on []
  :evidence-for-active [Gravpad deployed; web annotation operational]

  + context: Gravpad does to the web what street art does to cities.
  + IF: You want to add commentary and transparency to the web without permission
  + HOWEVER: Current web infrastructure serves platform owners, not users
  + THEN: Build Gravpad as web annotation layer that adds traceability, commentary, and accountability information to existing web content
  + BECAUSE: Transparency infrastructure should not require permission from those being made transparent

  + EVIDENCE:
    evidence[Arxana provides annotation model]
    evidence[Web annotation standards exist]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define Gravpad MVP]
    next[Build annotation layer]
    next[Test on real web content]
    next[Document supply chain / externality use cases]

  :success-criteria
    pass[Annotations attach to web content]
    pass[No permission required from target sites]
    pass[Traceability information visible to users]
    fail[Annotations blocked or invisible]

! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Scenario Simulations [🚞/习 🔸/扎]
  :maturity :greenfield
  :depends-on [f6/P9]
  :evidence-for-active [Scenario bundles defined; simulations run; results documented]

  + context: Future structures should be tested before implementation.
  + IF: You want to prototype civic and economic forms before committing
  + HOWEVER: Abstract philosophy does not test well
  + THEN: Develop scenario bundles tied to F6 mathematical models; run simulations; document results and learnings
  + BECAUSE: Scenario practice turns philosophy into actionable design

  + EVIDENCE:
    evidence[F6 provides mathematical models]
    evidence[Scenario concepts identified]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define 2-3 scenario bundles]
    next[Tie scenarios to F6 models]

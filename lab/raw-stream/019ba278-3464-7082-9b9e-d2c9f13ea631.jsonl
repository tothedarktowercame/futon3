It is intentionally a thin summary of an\r\nepisode so the proof system can reason about AIF runs without storing full\r\nstep-by-step traces.\r\n\r\n## Why this exists\r\n\r\nFuton2 experiments generate AIF episode traces (step results). Futon3 needs a\r\ncompact, comparable payload that can be attached to proofs and workday entries\r\nso \"why this run looks healthy\" is visible in the same place as other evidence.\r\nThe AIF trace evidence gives that bridge: it is small, deterministic to compute,\r\nand stable enough to compare across runs.\r\n\r\nIn other words:\r\n- Futon2: produces rich per-tick traces.\r\n- Futon3: consumes a summary to support proof checks, drift detection, and\r\n  narrative explainers.\r\n- FuLab workflow: the same evidence can sit beside pattern checks, so humans can\r\n  read a proof and understand how the agent behaved.\r\n\r\n## Shape\r\n\r\nThe AIF evidence map is optional. When present, it must match the schema in\r\n`src/futon3/checks.clj`:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n{:g-mean 0.842\r\n :tau-range [0.12 0.88]\r\n :action-counts {:observe 12 :act 4}\r\n :constraint-violations [\"pattern-constraint-failed@act\"]} ; optional\r\n```\r\n\r\nFields:\r\n- `:g-mean` - average of the per-step `:G` values in the episode.\r\n- `:tau-range` - `[min max]` of per-step precision `:tau`.\r\n- `:action-counts` - frequency map of `:action` values.\r\n- `:constraint-violations` - optional list of failed constraints (if any).\r\n\r\nUnknown fields are rejected by validation.\r\n\r\n## How it is computed\r\n\r\nThe extraction logic lives in `src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj`:\r\n- `:g-mean` is computed from `:G` across all steps.\r\n- `:tau-range` is computed from `[:perception :prec :tau]` (or `[:prec :tau]`).\r\n- `:action-counts` is computed from per-step `:action` values.\r\n- `:constraint-violations` is derived from `[:pattern-trace :constraint-ok?]`\r\n  when false.\r\n\r\nThis is intentionally \"lossy\": it summarizes the episode without needing the\r\nfull trace.\r\n\r\n## Flow into checks\r\n\r\n1) An AIF runner builds a per-episode summary using `futon3.aif-bridge`.\r\n2) The summary is attached as `:aif-trace` on a workday payload or check request.\r\n3) `futon3.checks/check!` includes it in the proof as `:check/aif-trace`.\r\n\r\nIf it is missing, checks continue as usual.\r\n\r\n## Why these metrics\r\n\r\nThese fields were chosen because they are:\r\n- Stable: aggregate values do not explode when a single tick varies.\r\n- Interpretable: a human can glance at g-mean, tau spread, and actions.\r\n- Minimal: enough to compare runs and spot drift, without storing full traces.\r\n\r\nFor example, rising g-mean with a narrowing tau range suggests confidence, while\r\naction-counts show whether a policy is shifting in behavior.\r\n\r\n## Example (check request -> proof)\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n{:pattern/id \"mojo/west\"\r\n :context \"AIF episode with 40 ticks\"\r\n :aif-trace {:g-mean 0.842\r\n             :tau-range [0.12 0.88]\r\n             :action-counts {:observe 12 :act 4}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProof excerpt:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n{:proof/id \"proof-...\"\r\n :pattern/id \"mojo/west\"\r\n :check/aif-trace {:g-mean 0.842\r\n                   :tau-range [0.12 0.88]\r\n                   :action-counts {:observe 12 :act 4}}\r\n :proof/status :ready}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Scope and non-goals\r\n\r\nThis is not a trace store. If you need the full episode history, keep it in\r\nFuton2 or your experiment log and attach only the summary here.\r\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

Use the stack-coherence patterns (e.g. `stack-blocker-detection`) to spot empty dirs or missing artifacts and record `blocked-by[...]` until the prerequisite is done.\\\\r\\\\n- Watch for repeated sigil pairs in devmaps. The pattern library (e.g. `pattern-differentiation-alarms`) treats duplicates as alarms: either split/merge the underlying patterns, add a more specific devmap-coherence flexiarg, or retire stale clauses. After adjustments, rerun the TF–IDF embedding + sigil matrices so the fake embedding stays meaningful.\\\\r\\\\n- Contribute new stack-coherence patterns whenever the project needs cross-futon checks (e.g. comparing READMEs vs git logs). These global patterns should inspect hotspots—git history, README timestamps, file trees—to classify each devmap item as “done / blocked / drifting” and help the informal proof engine keep the whole stack honest.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n## MUSN stuff\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nF2 (MUSN) — One-Page Build Brief\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nScope (thin waist): Transport + routing only.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\\\\r\\\\n### Available skills\\\\r\\\\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/joe/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\\\\r\\\\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/joe/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\\\\r\\\\n### How to use skills\\\\r\\\\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\\\\r\\\\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\\\\r\\\\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\\\\r\\\\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\\\\r\\\\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\\\\r\\\\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\\\\r\\\\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\\\\r\\\\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\\\\r\\\\n- Coordination and sequencing:\\\\r\\\\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\\\\r\\\\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\\\\r\\\\n- Context hygiene:\\\\r\\\\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\\\\r\\\\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\\\\r\\\\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\\\\r\\\\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\\\\r\\\\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\\\\r\\\\n#+END_EXAMPLE\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n* msg:019b9ea5-b4be-7aa0-8736-25c34b5be522:u002 (user) 2026-01-08T17:26:58.542Z\\\\r\\\\n#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\\\\r\\\\n<environment_context>\\\\r\\\\n  <cwd>/home/joe/code/futon3</cwd>\\\\r\\\\n  <approval_policy>never</approval_policy>\\\\r\\\\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write</sandbox_mode>\\\\r\\\\n  <network_access>restricted</network_access>\\\\r\\\\n  <shell>bash</shell>\\\\r\\\\n</environment_context>\\\\r\\\\n#+END_EXAMPLE\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n* msg:019b9ea5-b4be-7aa0-8736-25c34b5be522:u003 (user) 2026-01-08T17:26:58.575Z\\\\r\\\\n#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE\\\\r\\\\nYou are running in exploratory pattern mode.

{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_85","type":"agent_message","text":"Added AIF G-term breakdown and term-provenance plumbing so AIF ticks and summaries can carry term means and channel provenance, with schema validation and updated trace docs in `src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj`, `src/futon3/tatami_schema.clj`, `src/futon3/checks.clj`, and `docs/aif-trace.md`.\n\n**Pattern Selection**\n- Candidates and why:\n- `aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard`: current AIF trace only logs scalar `:G`, so adding term breakdowns makes G interpretable.\n- `aif/term-to-channel-traceability`: no explicit provenance for term inputs; adding term channel maps makes scoring audit-friendly.\n- `aif/evidence-precision-registry`: already present in `src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj`, so less incremental benefit this session.\n- `aif/structured-observation-vector`: already implemented; no clear new change to express it now.\n- Selected for this session:\n- `aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard`\n- `aif/term-to-channel-traceability`\n\n**Clock-Ins And Resume**\n- Clock-in 1: `aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard` (intent: add G-term breakdown capture + summary fields).\n- Resume: continued the session after scorecard wiring to apply a second AIF pattern.\n- Clock-in 2: `aif/term-to-channel-traceability` (intent: add term provenance normalization + channel summaries).\n\n**Pattern Changes**\n- `aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard`: added `:g-breakdown` normalization and validation in `src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj`, exposed `:g-terms` in the episode evidence, and extended schemas in `src/futon3/tatami_schema.clj` + `src/futon3/checks.clj` for explicit term breakdowns.\n- `aif/term-to-channel-traceability`: added term provenance normalization + validation in `src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj`, summarized `:g-term-channels` in episode evidence, and documented the new optional fields in `docs/aif-trace.md`.\n\n**PSR/PUR Records**\n```clojure\n{:psr/id \"psr-aif-efs-001\"\n :session/id \"futon3-aif-efs-001\"\n :decision/id \"futon3-aif-efs-001:decision-1\"\n :pattern/id \"aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard\"\n :candidates [\"aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard\" \"aif/term-to-channel-traceability\"]\n :chosen \"aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard\"\n :context/anchors [{:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj\"}\n                   {:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"src/futon3/checks.clj\"}]\n :forecast {:benefits [{:tag :benefit/traceable-scorecard\n                        :locus {:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj\"}\n                        :note \"G terms persist alongside scalar G.\"}]\n            :risks [{:tag :risk/missing-terms\n                     :locus {:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj\"}\n                     :note \"Term breakdown may be absent from upstream.\"}]}\n :horizon :immediate}\n\n{:pur/id \"pur-aif-efs-001\"\n :session/id \"futon3-aif-efs-001\"\n :pattern/id \"aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard\"\n :decision/id \"futon3-aif-efs-001:decision-1\"\n :anchors [{:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj\"}\n           {:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"src/futon3/checks.clj\"}]\n :outcome/tags [:outcome/success]\n :fields {:context \"Added G-term breakdown normalization and evidence summary fields.\"\n          :then \"AIF traces now record term means for auditability.\"}}\n```\n\n```clojure\n{:psr/id \"psr-aif-ttc-001\"\n :session/id \"futon3-aif-ttc-001\"\n :decision/id \"futon3-aif-ttc-001:decision-1\"\n :pattern/id \"aif/term-to-channel-traceability\"\n :candidates [\"aif/term-to-channel-traceability\" \"aif/expected-free-energy-scorecard\"]\n :chosen \"aif/term-to-channel-traceability\"\n :context/anchors [{:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj\"}\n                   {:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"docs/aif-trace.md\"}]\n :forecast {:benefits [{:tag :benefit/traceable-terms\n                        :locus {:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj\"}\n                        :note \"Term provenance tracked with channels.\"}]\n            :risks [{:tag :risk/empty-provenance\n                     :locus {:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"docs/aif-trace.md\"}\n                     :note \"Upstream may not emit provenance yet.\"}]}\n :horizon :immediate}\n\n{:pur/id \"pur-aif-ttc-001\"\n :session/id \"futon3-aif-ttc-001\"\n :pattern/id \"aif/term-to-channel-traceability\"\n :decision/id \"futon3-aif-ttc-001:decision-1\"\n :anchors [{:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"src/futon3/aif_bridge.clj\"}\n           {:anchor/type :file :anchor/ref \"docs/aif-trace.md\"}]\n :outcome/tags [:outcome/success]\n :fields {:context \"Normalized term provenance and summarized term channels in evidence.\"\n          :then \"AIF traces now report term-to-channel mappings.\"}}\n```\n\nTests not run.\n\nIf you want to validate the new trace fields end-to-end, you could:\n1) Run an AIF trace through your normal `aif/validate-aif-proof` flow to confirm the new optional fields serialize cleanly.\n2) Re-run any local proof checks that consume `:aif-trace` to ensure schema acceptance."}}

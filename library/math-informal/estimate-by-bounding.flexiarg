! conclusion:
  Replace a complicated quantity with a simpler bound that is good enough.

  + context: You need to control a quantity (an integral, a sum, a probability, a norm) but
    exact computation is infeasible or unnecessary.
  + IF:
      You need an upper bound (or lower bound) rather than an exact value, and standard
      inequalities (triangle, Cauchy-Schwarz, Jensen, Markov, Chebyshev, AM-GM) are
      available.

  + HOWEVER:
      Bounds lose information. A bound that is too loose is useless. The art is in choosing
      the tightest bound that remains tractable. Chaining too many inequalities can
      accumulate slack to the point of triviality.

  + THEN:
      Identify which direction you need (upper or lower). Apply the most appropriate
      standard inequality. Check that the resulting bound is tight enough for your
      purposes. If not, try a different inequality or a more refined decomposition
      before bounding.

  + BECAUSE:
      Estimation is the engine of analysis and probability. Most theorems in these fields
      are proved by chains of inequalities, each replacing something complicated with
      something simpler. Knowing which inequality to reach for is a core skill.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Determine whether you need an upper or lower bound.]
    next[Identify candidate inequalities from your toolbox.]
    next[Apply and check tightness — is the bound strong enough?]

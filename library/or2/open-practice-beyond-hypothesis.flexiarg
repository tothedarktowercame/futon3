! conclusion: Open Practice Beyond Hypothesis
  + context: You are making practice-based research legible without forcing it into hypothesis templates.
  + IF:
    Arts and performance research produces experiential, multimodal knowledge that resists hypothesis-driven templates.
  + HOWEVER:
    Repository forms, REF narratives, and grant portals still assume linear methods, fixed datasets, and analytic prose, so practice-based work becomes distorted or underspecified.
  + THEN:
    Name Arts as the west-node chariot: use License-as-Story and Story DOIs to contextualise practice, apply the Method/Documentary Split (PROTOCOL.md vs LOG.md) to separate intention from creative trace, and build small narrative bridges—audio snippets, annotated scores—instead of forcing data schemas.
  + BECAUSE:
    Open Research serves Arts when it clarifies lineage, process, and situated intention; story-driven artefacts preserve dignity, reduce administrative friction, and let practice be legible without erasing its form.
  + NEXT-STEPS:

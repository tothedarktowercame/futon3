! conclusion:
  The usefulness of extracted reasoning cues must be tested through
  collective understanding rather than model accuracy, because the target
  outcome is shared clarity among diverse learners.

  + context: You are defining evaluation in terms of shared clarity across cohorts rather than model accuracy.
  + IF:
    Value-flow and festival patterns show that gatherings enable collective
    sense-making only when participants can relate their own understanding
    to a visible shared artefact.

  + HOWEVER:
    Standard AI metrics (e.g. step-wise correctness) say little about
    whether undergraduates, postgraduates, and professionals can actually
    use the annotated proofs to reason together; they hide where explanations
    help, where they confuse, and where they leave gaps.

  + THEN:
    Run tiered seminars in which identical annotated proofs are reviewed by
    different cohorts, log guided discussions using consistent prompts, and
    treat clarity/confusion reports as primary evaluation signals, feeding
    them back into ready/blocked-style triage so blockers are explicit.

  + BECAUSE:
    Collective intelligence is evidenced when diverse readers reach a
    workable shared understanding of the argument; only structured
    discussion around common artefacts can reveal whether the extracted
    reasoning cues support this outcome.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Schedule undergraduate, graduate, and professional seminar sessions using the same annotated proofs and capture transcripts for comparison.]
    next[Pipe transcript-coded blockers into stack-coherence/ready-blocked-triage so explanatory weaknesses are visible to the whole project.]

! conclusion: Exploration without limits drifts; any search needs a budget that forces commitment or escalation.
  + context: An agent explores options—spatial locations, semantic regions, conversation branches, solution candidates.
  + IF:
    The agent must balance discovering new possibilities against making progress on known paths.
  + HOWEVER:
    Unbounded exploration leads to wander: the agent keeps looking without ever committing, exhausting resources without output.
  + THEN:
    Assign explicit budgets (time, steps, tokens, reads) to exploratory phases and define reset rules. When budget nears exhaustion, force a decision: commit to best-so-far, escalate to a supervisor, or explicitly expand scope with justification.
  + BECAUSE:
    Budgets convert open-ended search into bounded decisions, making progress measurable and preventing silent resource drain.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Identify unbounded loops in your agent (e.g., "keep searching until found").
    - Add budget parameters with sensible defaults and observable countdowns.
    - Design escalation paths for when budgets expire without resolution and log the choice taken.

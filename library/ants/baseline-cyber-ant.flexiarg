! conclusion:
  Treat the baseline cyber-ant as a narratable instance of the Futon2 AIF loop:
  its observation ABI, predictive-cycle trace, hunger dynamics, and policy harness
  are all frozen so Futon5 can lift the behaviour into an operator.

  + context: You are turning the Futon2 AIF loop into a portable pattern asset for Futon5.
  + IF:
    You want a generated agent to behave exactly like today’s handcrafted AIF
    ants, including mode hysteresis, hunger/tau coupling, and softmax tilts.

  + HOWEVER:
    The implementation currently lives as code and tests inside Futon2; none of
    those behaviours are catalogued as pattern data Futon5 can compile.

  + THEN:
    Canonically describe the loop from `g-observe` → `perceive/perceive` →
    `affect/update-tau` → `policy/choose-action`, referencing the single-tick
    trace (`doc/trace/single_tick.*`) and policy harness goldens so Futon5 has
    deterministic source material.

  + BECAUSE:
    Once the narrative and fixtures exist as pattern assets, Futon5 can attach a
    `:cyber/baseline` operator that emits an AIF config identical to Futon2’s
    defaults, making cyber-ants “pattern flashed” twins of the current species.

    next[Bind this description to a Futon5 operator signature that exports the
         `:aif` config delta plus textual explanation for cyber-ant flashing.]

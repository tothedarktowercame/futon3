@title Prototype Alignment — Tension & Readiness Check

! conclusion:
  inspect the context/if/however clauses for at least one named tension and a readiness window (criteria or timing); emit follow-up obligations when those markers are missing

  + context: Identify and articulate any named tensions and readiness criteria in your prototypes to ensure they remain testable.
  + IF:
    a prototype names risks, frictions, or unknowns in its context

  + HOWEVER:
    many devmap entries fail to mark the tension explicitly or to state when the prototype will be “ready” for handoff

  + THEN:
    inspect the context/if/however clauses for at least one named tension and a readiness window (criteria or timing); emit follow-up obligations when those markers are missing

  + BECAUSE:
    Surfacing tensions (per p4ng) and defining readiness windows keep prototypes testable and prevent surprise failures downstream

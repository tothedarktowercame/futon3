! conclusion: Not striving-for but the striving faculty operating — energy arising and applying naturally in one intent on the undefiled, without a striver separate from the striving.
  + context: This operates in one developing the noble path. Right effort functions "to give up wrong X and embrace right X" for each factor — the energetic commitment operating as path-factor.
  + IF:
    Even skillful effort involves an efforter — one who takes credit for trying hard, who identifies with progress. Effort can become exhausting when there's someone getting tired.
  + HOWEVER:
    The path requires energy — things don't happen without some activation. The question is whether energy flows from identification or from the path functioning.
  + THEN:
    Noble right effort is the striving faculty operating in context of the path — "they make an effort to give up wrong and embrace right" — but the 'they' is transparent, not solid. Effort arising as expression of path, not as personal project.
  + BECAUSE:
    Right effort runs and circles around all the other factors — it is what makes the difference between understanding and doing, between knowing and practicing. Noble right effort is this energetic commitment functioning without an exhaustible efforter.
  + TRANSCENDENT-QUALITY:
    - Not "I am trying hard" but trying happening through one intent on the noble
    - Energy that neither exhausts through grasping nor dissipates through slackness
    - Effort transparent to path-factors
    - The four strivings operating without a striver
  + THE-RUNNING-CIRCLE:
    Right effort is one of the three that run and circle around all the other factors: "Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness" — the effort to give up wrong and embrace right.
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-MUNDANE:
    Mundane: "I apply the four efforts" (an I applying)
    Noble: The striving faculty operating, intent on the undefiled
  + WORN-AWAY:
    "For one of right effort, wrong effort is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong effort are worn away."

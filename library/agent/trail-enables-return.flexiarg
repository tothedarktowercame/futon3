! conclusion: Leave traces that allow backtracking; an agent that can't retrace its path can't recover from mistakes.
  + context: An agent navigates through states, decisions, or locations over time.
  + IF:
    The agent may need to undo actions, revisit prior states, or learn from dead ends.
  + HOWEVER:
    Without a trail, the agent cannot distinguish "unexplored" from "explored and rejected," leading to repeated mistakes or inability to recover.
  + THEN:
    Record a trail of moves, decisions, and state transitions. Make the trail queryable so the agent (or its successors) can backtrack, detect loops, and learn from history.
  + BECAUSE:
    Trails convert ephemeral navigation into persistent structure. They enable learning, debugging, and graceful recovery.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Decide what granularity of trail your agent needs (every step? key decisions only?).
    - Implement trail storage that survives across sessions if work spans multiple runs.
    - Add trail-query primitives: "have I been here?", "how did I get here?", "what failed last time?"

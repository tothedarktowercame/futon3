! conclusion: Treat futon1 as immutable/versioned source of truth for patterns; sync bidirectionally (drafts back via tri-store), logging pattern version IDs per run.
  + context: Defining how the exotic programming system stays synchronized with the upstream pattern library.
  + IF:
    Patterns evolve in futon1; exotic programming depends on patterns; generated patterns may flow back upstream.
  + HOWEVER:
    One-time import drifts out of date; continuous sync without versioning loses reproducibility; one-way sync prevents learning from flowing back.
  + THEN:
    Implement live sync: futon1 is the immutable, versioned source of truth for canonical patterns. Log which pattern version was used in each run. Sync is bidirectional: drafts generated by exotic programming flow back to futon1 via the tri-store (facts → memes → upstream proposal).
  + BECAUSE:
    Version logging enables reproducibility (you know exactly which patterns were active). Bidirectional flow closes the loop (exotic programming improves the pattern library that exotic programming uses). Immutable source of truth prevents accidental overwrites.
    + evidence: exotic-programming-curriculum.md Basecamp decision log, Import cadence entry; scripts/import_futon3a_patterns.clj.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Add pattern version ID to run logs.
    - Implement upstream proposal pathway for drafts.
    - Define version bump protocol for futon1.

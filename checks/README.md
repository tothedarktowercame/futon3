# `checks/` — derived behavioural witnesses over library edges

A flexiarg is **abstract** — a production rule at specification grain. Whether a
`@how` edge actually holds is **derived**, not stored: a relation run forward
against stated facts, in the third verification layer of
`futon2.aif.operational-witness` (*interface → structure → **behaviour***).

Run:

    clojure -Sdeps '{:paths ["checks"] :deps {org.clojure/core.logic {:mvn/version "1.0.1"}}}' \
      -M -m how-witness-snatch

**Every witness must ship with a mirror** — the same relation asked of a case
where it must *not* hold. A witness that cannot fail is not a witness.

| file | what it does | result |
|---|---|---|
| `how_witness_snatch.clj` | the edge as a **relation** — does it hold? | **ATTESTED**; mirror silent |
| `how_kernel_snatch.clj` | the same edge as a **kernel** — with what spread? | entropy 1.3863 → 1.3121 nats under attestation; mirror zero mass |

## Why both

`Rel` is copy–discard but **not Markov**: a relation may be partial and lose
mass. A kernel is total. So `run*` answers *which outcomes are possible* and the
kernel answers *how much mass each carries* — the relation supplies the
**support**, the Beta posterior supplies the **mass**.

An unattested edge is Beta(1,1): uniform, maximum entropy, **maximum epistemic
value**. You learn most by testing the method nobody has attested.

`Beta(1,1)` is a **prior**, therefore a stipulation, and is declared in the
source rather than absorbed — per `S-G3` in
`p4ng/empirics-futon/NOTE-a-standard-for-G.md`.

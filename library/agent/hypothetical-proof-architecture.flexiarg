! conclusion:
  Before investing effort in a proof path, sketch multiple complete proof architectures as
  wiring diagrams with explicit node status (solid/open/blocked). Triage immediately to
  focus effort on the most promising path.

  + context: You have a theorem to prove with multiple plausible approaches. Each approach
    has several steps, some established and some open. The temptation is to start with the
    "obvious" or "natural" approach and push until stuck.

  + IF:
      There are 3+ plausible proof paths, each with multiple steps. Some steps are
      established results, some are open problems, and some may be blocked by known
      obstructions. The risk profile of each path (number of open steps, their independence,
      known difficulties) varies significantly.

  + HOWEVER:
      Sketching architectures is upfront cost. For problems with one clear approach, it's
      overkill. Only invest in this when the proof landscape is genuinely multi-path and the
      cost of pursuing a dead end is high (weeks of work, not hours).

  + THEN:
      1. For each plausible proof path, draw a complete wiring diagram from hypotheses to
         conclusion.
      2. Mark each node as: solid (established), open (needs work), or blocked (known
         obstruction).
      3. Kill blocked paths immediately.
      4. Compare open paths on: (a) number of open nodes, (b) whether open nodes are
         sequential (each depends on the previous) or parallel (independent), (c) whether
         any open node is a known hard problem.
      5. Prioritize paths with fewer open nodes, parallel structure, and no known-hard
         sub-problems.

  + BECAUSE:
      Sequential open obstacles multiply risk (if any one fails, the entire path fails).
      Parallel open sub-goals reduce risk (any one success may suffice). A path with one
      open node is strictly better than a path with three sequential open nodes, even if
      the single node is harder, because success is binary: one hard question has the same
      risk profile as three easy questions in series but is easier to focus on.

  + FAILURE-MODES:
      - Architecture bias: sketching only 2-3 paths and missing the best one. Cast the
        net wide initially; narrow after triage.
      - False "blocked" assessment: marking a path as blocked based on a surface reading
        of an obstruction, when the obstruction has a workaround. Verify blocks carefully.
      - Triage paralysis: spending too long comparing paths instead of working on the
        best one. The triage should take hours, not days.

  + EVIDENCE:
      P7 lattices with 2-torsion (futon6, Feb 2026): 5 hypothetical proof architectures
      (H1-H5) were sketched for the S obligation. Two (H3, H5) were immediately killed
      (codim-2 gap fails for reflections; Gauss-Bonnet kills Fowler in odd dim). One (H2)
      was deprioritized (3 sequential obstacles with structural headwinds). The winner (H1,
      rotation route) was not the "obvious" continuation but had the best risk profile:
      one open question (lattice existence) with no known blocker, plus two parallel
      S-branch options.

    next[Sketch 3-5 complete proof architectures as wiring diagrams.]
    next[Mark node status: solid, open, blocked.]
    next[Kill blocked paths, deprioritize sequential-obstacle paths.]
    next[Focus on the path with fewest independent open nodes.]

! conclusion:
  Recognise that the project treats proof patterns as a hypothesised mid-level
  hierarchy, analogous to the hierarchy of mathematical concepts, and uses a
  small, controlled study to see whether local fragments of this hierarchy can
  be made visible.

  + context: You are framing proof patterns as a mid-level hierarchy the pilot can sample in a controlled way.
  + IF:
    Mathematicians rely on recurring tactics—"reduce to a simpler case", "apply
    a standard theorem", "argue by symmetry"—that function like proof patterns:
    reusable structures sitting between informal heuristics and fully formal
    derivations.

  + HOWEVER:
    This implicit hierarchy of proof patterns has never been systematically
    mapped, and a six-month pilot cannot construct it in full. Existing texts
    only show traces of these patterns, mixed with both exploratory and
    expository language.

  + THEN:
    Use a gain-of-function style approach: focus on a small, curated set of
    worked proofs, amplify the strongest informal and expository cues, and see
    whether any stable, recognisable pattern fragments can be annotated
    consistently across examples.

  + BECAUSE:
    If such fragments can be identified and linked to specific objects and
    steps, they provide the first empirical foothold on an underlying proof-
    pattern hierarchy, even if only at a local scale. If they cannot, this
    reveals real limits on what present methods can recover.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Treat recurring tactic descriptors that survive annotation as candidate proof-pattern atoms.]
    next[Report how often they appear, where they fail, and what cues were discarded.]
    next[Use findings to guide future, larger-scale work on proof-pattern structure.]

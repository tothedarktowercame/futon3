! conclusion: Steward of the Open Research Emporium
  + context: You are naming library stewardship as the infrastructure that makes OR navigable.
  + IF:
    Library OR teams quietly hold metadata, repositories, visibility, and preservation work that lets research feel navigable.
  + HOWEVER:
    Their labour is framed as routine administration; workloads rise without recognition, and stewardship remains invisible even though it props up every School.
  + THEN:
    Position the Library node as the Steward of an Open Research Emporium. Use Story DOIs, Identifier Gardens, and Platform Choreography to make deposits, licences, and showcases effortless, and curate a narrative Emporium page that links live projects to preserved artefacts.
  + BECAUSE:
    When stewardship is named as the ground the system stands on, it becomes negentropic—reducing duplication, clarifying provenance, and giving researchers trust that OR support lightens rather than loads their work.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Draft the Emporium page outline and identify 3 live projects to feature.]
    next[Use this pattern to frame handover materials, case study templates, and video publication as stewardship work.]

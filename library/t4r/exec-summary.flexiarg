! conclusion: talk4real reimagines doctoral training as a shared experimental learning infrastructure that continually refines itself through reflexive, collective practice. [🏡/工]
  + context: You are framing the executive summary as a compact, inspectable pattern.
  + IF:
    The proposal must persuade funders while staying aligned with the pattern canon.
  + HOWEVER:
    Narrative prose can obscure the reasoning and make claims drift.
  + THEN:
    Anchor the summary in explicit pattern logic before drafting the final prose.
    Apply a REPL-style cycle—read, evaluate, print, loop—so ethnography, computational analysis, design, and collective reflection remain linked.
    Run coordinated doctoral projects that instantiate the same learning architecture in distinct domains.
    Treat each doctoral scholar as both a researcher and an agent of collective intelligence.
  + BECAUSE:
    Most doctoral programmes operate within disciplinary or thematic silos, limiting cross-boundary learning and system-level improvement.
    Collective-intelligence frameworks can capture feedback between researchers, institutions, and communities so research systems learn from their own activity.
    The model is structured by ethical reflexivity (co-authored representation), lightweight infrastructure (portable method), and polyphonic governance (synthesised voices).
    Related precedents include initiatives such as realtalk@MIT, PlanetMath.org, and Peeragogy.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Refine the exemplars and verify each claim against the supporting pattern set.]
    next[Insert 1-2 current, funder-recognisable exemplars of collective-intelligence infrastructure.]

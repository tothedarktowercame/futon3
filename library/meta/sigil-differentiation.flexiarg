! conclusion:
  Treat repeated sigil pairs as design questions: either reassign the pair or
  refine the overlapping patterns so their scopes stop colliding.

  + context: You are maintaining sigil uniqueness so similarity search stays meaningful.
  + IF:
    `clojure -M:sigils` reports duplicated pairs (e.g., 🔃/入 across four patterns).

  + HOWEVER:
    Without a protocol, collisions linger and the fake embedding loses meaning.

  + THEN:
    For each collision, decide whether to (a) retag one pattern, (b) refine the
    overlapping patterns so their scope edges are explicit, or (c) introduce a
    new pattern that captures the differentiating concept while linking back to
    the originals. Record the relationship and decision in futon3 before rerun-
    ning the sigil job.

  + BECAUSE:
    Sigils are coordinates; when they overlap, dhammavicaya can’t distinguish
    patterns, so we must either move the coordinate or reshape the terrain.

  + STATUS:
    status[ready]
    evidence[resources/sigils/emoji-adjacency.csv]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Create a rolling “sigil collision queue” entry in futon3 and tick off pairs as we reassign or refine them.]

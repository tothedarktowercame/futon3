! conclusion: Refrain from killing living creatures, from taking what is not given, and from sexual misconduct — abstaining from the three forms of bodily misconduct.
  + context: This operates in all situations involving bodily action — how we treat other living beings, how we relate to resources, how we engage in intimate relationships.
  + IF:
    Bodily actions create the most direct and often irreversible consequences. Harm done physically is harder to undo than harm done verbally or mentally.
  + HOWEVER:
    External compliance without inner transformation is fragile. And "being good" can become performance or suppression. The problem is not acting but acting from craving or aversion.
  + THEN:
    Practice the three refrainings: from killing (harming living beings), from stealing (taking what isn't freely given), from sexual misconduct (violating relational boundaries and trust). This is the content of mundane right action.
  + BECAUSE:
    Mundane right action creates conditions for safety, trust, and respect. But one can refrain from wrong action while still attached to being a "good person" or to the social status that moral conduct confers. This is better than wrong action but not yet liberation.
  + MUNDANE-CONTENT:
    - Refraining from killing: not intentionally harming living beings
    - Refraining from stealing: not taking what is not given
    - Refraining from sexual misconduct: not violating relational boundaries
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-WRONG-ACTION:
    Wrong action: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct
    Mundane right action: refraining from these three — AND awareness that the refraining itself can be grasped
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Notice the subtler forms: carelessness with beings, casual taking, boundary-blurring.
    - Track how bodily conduct shapes relationships and environments over time.
    - Ask: is this action reversible? does it preserve future options?
  + RIPENS-IN:
    Less harm, more trust, cleaner relationships — but still within the world of actors and acted-upon, still attached to being one who refrains.
  + RELATED-PATTERNS:
    - liberation/noble/right-action (the abstaining faculty beyond content)
    - liberation/mundane/right-speech (parallel in verbal domain)

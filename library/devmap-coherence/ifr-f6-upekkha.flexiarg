! conclusion:
  confirm that F6 only imports vetted pattern nodes via the F3 bridge, that each dictionary entry links back to proof evidence, and that the math-aware agent protocols consume these structures instead of raw flexiargs

  + context: Confirm that only vetted entries are imported to ensure consistency and reliability in your patterns.
  + IF:
    FUTON6 curates Hyperreal math entries and scholium landscapes fed by FUTON3 checks

  + HOWEVER:
    duplication creeps in if F6 reimplements flexiform infrastructure or fails to reflect new proofs

  + THEN:
    confirm that F6 only imports vetted pattern nodes via the F3 bridge, that each dictionary entry links back to proof evidence, and that the math-aware agent protocols consume these structures instead of raw flexiargs

  + BECAUSE:
    upekkhā here means balanced reasoning—F6 must remain a calm curator of math, not another sandbox

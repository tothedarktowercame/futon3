! conclusion: talk4real can deliver scalable, ethical, self-renewing collective research development with modest resources by leveraging lightweight assets and distributed partnerships. [👫/女 🌞/工]
  + context: You are justifying resource efficiency and partnership leverage in funding prose.
  + IF:
    Funders need to see that support costs stay proportionate to outcomes.
  + HOWEVER:
    Budget narratives can hide dependencies or inflate required resources.
  + THEN:
    Ground the support case in concrete partner assets and shared infrastructure.
  + BECAUSE:
    The main assets are conversation, computation, and coordination already present in partner institutions, so core costs focus on stipends, workshops, and hosting.
    Partners such as the UK Reproducibility Network, PathOS, and the Oxford Schwartzman Centre plus allied studios and labs contribute mentoring and in-kind expertise.
    Open-source software, shared cloud infrastructure, and cross-university collaboration keep financial overhead minimal while maximising reach.
    Outputs remain freely available, ensuring continuing value beyond the funding window.
  + NEXT-STEPS:

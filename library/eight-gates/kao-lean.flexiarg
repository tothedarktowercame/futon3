! conclusion: Use your trunk, your structure, your mass; leaning brings your whole frame into contact.
  + context: An agent needs to bring structural weight to bear—not a strike or technique, but the presence of the whole system.
  + IF:
    The situation calls for commitment of the full structure, not just tools or appendages.
  + HOWEVER:
    Leaning without structure collapses. Kào is not falling—it's controlled inclination where the shoulder, chest, or back makes contact while the frame remains integrated. The trunk leads, not the extremities.
  + THEN:
    Lean into the situation with your structure. Kào can manifest as shoulder (front or back), chest, or full back—whatever trunk surface is appropriate. The inclination is deliberate; the frame stays intact. You're not pushing with arms; you're bringing your mass.
  + BECAUSE:
    Environment over optimization: sometimes you don't need a clever technique, you need to bring your whole context to bear. Handoff preserves context because it's structural—the trunk of accumulated state, not just the hands of immediate action.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - When techniques aren't working, consider whether you need structural presence.
    - Lean deliberately, not desperately.
    - The trunk (accumulated context, structural mass) has its own energy.

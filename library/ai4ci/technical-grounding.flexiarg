! conclusion:
  Understand that the MUSN pilot stands on existing transport guarantees
  (schema-validated ingest, adapter bridges) and pushes one incremental step:
  linking informal phraseology to structured reasoning hypotheses.

  + IF:
    `docs/protocol.md` and `src/f2/router.clj` already enforce msg-id
    idempotency, timeout bounds, and schema validation for hello/event/export/
    run/status.

  + HOWEVER:
    Named-entity / relation extraction only tells us which objects appear, not
    how informal cues describe tactics or mid-level strategy.

  + THEN:
    Treat NER/RE outputs as anchors, cluster recurring informal phrases around
    them, and test whether MUSN can label tactic hypotheses that survive human
    review—all while keeping transport logs untouched.

  + BECAUSE:
    This isolates the research question (informal → structure) from baseline
    engineering, giving reviewers a falsifiable claim.

  + STATUS:
    status[ready]
    evidence[docs/protocol.md:1]
    evidence[src/f2/router.clj:1]

  + NEXT:
    next[Prototype the phrase→tactic linker on a 10-proof sample and record success/failure per hypothesis.]
    next[Document how rejected hypotheses flowed through MUSN so adapters stay schema-compatible.]

! conclusion:
  This specification extends the futonic vocabulary (futonic-logic.flexiarg) with
  four operators that were implicit in practice but unnamed: ref (anaphora), reframe
  (discourse redirection), reverse-morphogenesis (constraint-from-fruit), and ←
  (speculative history). The central insight: asking a good question IS reverse
  morphogenesis — given a formed artifact and a sense of what matters, infer the
  constraints that would make the form yield what matters. The ← operator names
  the speculative-history reading: 象 ← 香 means "given this form (象) and this
  salience (香), what constraints made the form stable?"

  These operators connect the futonic loop to futon6's mathematical dictionary:
  the flexiformal pathway (EXPLORE → ASSIMILATE → CANALIZE) is reverse
  morphogenesis applied to mathematical content at increasing formality.

  == 0. RELATIONSHIP TO FUTONIC LOGIC ==

  futonic-logic.flexiarg defines the vocabulary (象, 部, 咅, 香, 味, 鹽, 鹵, 皿,
  未知, 非死非活, 🔮) and the futonic loop. This specification adds four operators
  that act ON that vocabulary:

  | Operator | Acts on | Does what |
  | ref | 象, evidence entries | Points to existing meaning without creating new |
  | reframe | ref edges | Redirects reference ("but actually, the relevant thing is...") |
  | reverse-morphogenesis | 象 + fruit | Infers constraints from observed form and desired yield |
  | ← (speculative history) | 象 + 香 | Reads backwards: what constraints induced by 香 made 象 stable? |

  None of these replace existing vocabulary. They are higher-order operations
  that the futonic loop performs but did not previously name.

  == 1. ANAPHORA: REF VS BIND ==

  (vocabulary-extension
    (ref  (role reference)
          (note "Points to an existing binder/artifact without creating meaning.
                 Discourse trigger: 'this', 'that', 'the above', 'it'."))
    (bind (role creation)
          (note "Creates a new entry in a scope. An append!, a definition,
                 a new evidence entry.")))

  A binding lives in exactly one scope:

  (A8-scope-discipline
    (forall b (implies (bind? b) (exists-unique s (in-scope b s))))
    (forall s1 s2 (implies (parent s2 s1) (scope? s1) (scope? s2))))

  A ref does not create meaning; it points to an existing binder:

  (A9-anaphora
    (forall r (implies (ref? r) (exists t (targets r t))))
    (note "Every ref edge has a target. Dangling refs are structural errors."))

  Grounding in futon3c:
  - ArtifactRef is a ref edge: {:ref/type :mission :ref/id "M-forum-refactor"}
  - :evidence/in-reply-to is a ref edge: points to parent entry
  - :evidence/fork-of is a ref edge: points to branch point
  - append! is a bind: creates a new entry in the evidence store scope
  - get-entry is a ref resolution: given an ID, return what it points to

  The evidence landscape's append-only discipline means: binds are permanent,
  refs are navigable, and the difference is structural, not accidental.

  == 2. REFRAME: DISCOURSE REDIRECTION ==

  (vocabulary-extension
    (reframe (role discourse-redirection)
             (note "Higher-order edge that retargets a ref. 'But actually'
                    changes what 'it' refers to.")))

  (A10-reframe
    (forall u r t1 t2
      (implies
        (edge reframe u)
        (edge ref r)
        (targets r t1)
        (retargeted-by r u t2)
        (prefer-target r t2)))
    (note "A reframe can override the default target of a ref edge.
           The original target is not destroyed; the preference changes."))

  Grounding in futon3c:
  - ClaimType :correction is a reframe operator
  - EvidenceType :correction is a reframe operator
  - thread-conjectures returns :refuted when a correction references a conjecture
    — this is reframe in action: the conjecture's target (expected outcome) is
    redirected to the correction's finding

  Grounding in futonic practice:
  - IF/HOWEVER/THEN/BECAUSE: HOWEVER is a reframe. It says "the obvious ref
    (IF implies THEN directly) is wrong; actually, this obstacle changes the
    target."
  - PUR prediction error: "what surprised you" is a detected reframe — the
    expected target of the action was different from the actual target.

  == 3. REVERSE MORPHOGENESIS ==

  (vocabulary-extension
    (reverse-morphogenesis
      (role constraint-inference)
      (note "Given a formed artifact A and a salient yield/fruit F,
             infer constraints C such that C would make A-with-F stable.")))

  (A11-reverse-morphogenesis
    (forall A F C
      (implies
        (formed A)
        (fruit-of A F)
        (infer C (reverse-morphogenesis A F))
        (constrain C A)))
    (note "The constraints are not known in advance; they are inferred from
           the conjunction of form and desired fruit. This is design."))

  (corollary-design-as-reverse-morphogenesis
    (forall A F
      (implies
        (intended-fruit A F)
        (design-step A (reverse-morphogenesis A F))))
    (note "Design is the deliberate application of reverse morphogenesis:
           you know the fruit you want, you infer the constraints that
           produce it from the given form."))

  Grounding in futon practice:

  | Context | A (form) | F (fruit) | C (inferred constraints) |
  | L1 observer | Completed thread | Successful conclusion | Patterns that made it work |
  | Gate pipeline | Task submission | Validated proof path | Gate criteria that ensure quality |
  | Derivation xenotype | Domain (social coordination) | Working exotype | Requirements R1-R11 |
  | Question-asking | Mathematical object | Desired understanding | The question that would produce it |

  The last row is the key connection to futon6: asking a good mathematical
  question is reverse morphogenesis. You have a mathematical form (象). You
  have a sense of what understanding would be fruitful (香). The question is
  the constraint you infer: what would I need to know/prove/construct such
  that this form yields that understanding?

  == 4. ← AS SPECULATIVE HISTORY ==

  (vocabulary-extension
    (← (role speculative-history)
       (note "Reads backwards: given a stabilized form and a pre-individual
              field, infer the constraints that made the form stable under
              that field. 象 ← 香.")))

  (A12-speculative-history
    (← 象 香)
    (expansion
      (exists C
        (and (constrain C 象)
             (induced-by C 香)
             (realize 象 C))))
    (note "象 is realized under constraints induced by 香. The ← operator
           reads this relationship backwards: from the stabilized form,
           recover the constraint-from-taste."))

  ← is reverse-morphogenesis applied to the core vocabulary:
  - A = 象 (the stabilized form, configuration)
  - F = the stability itself (the form persists, couples to its environment)
  - 香 = the pre-individual field that induces the constraints
  - C = what ← infers

  This is NOT teleology. The form was not designed to satisfy 香. The reading
  is: 香 (as a difference field / gradient / taste) constrains which forms
  become stable. 象 is one such stable form. ← recovers that relationship.

  == 5. INSTRUMENTS AS ANTENNAS ==

  (corollary-antenna
    (forall I X
      (implies
        (instrument I) (field X)
        (detect I X) (not (creates I X))))
    (note "Artifacts can detect fields they do not create. A peripheral
           detects coordination patterns in the evidence landscape; it
           does not create the coordination."))

  Grounding:
  - Peripherals (explore/edit/test/deploy/reflect) are antennas: they have
    structural envelopes (tools, scope) that select from the evidence flow
    but do not generate it.
  - futon3a's pattern search (notions/compass) is an antenna: it detects
    salience (香) in the pattern library without creating patterns.
  - A mathematical dictionary entry (futon6) is an antenna: it stabilizes
    and selects from latent mathematical structure, it does not create the
    mathematics.

  The banjo-drum example from the source axioms:
  (latent (spectral-decomposition drum))
  (realize banjo (constraint (stabilize pitch) (select modes)))
  (reverse-morphogenesis banjo melody
    (requires (latent (spectral-decomposition drum))))

  The drum already carries the spectrum. The banjo stabilizes/selects.
  The melody is not teleology — it is the fruit that reverse morphogenesis
  reads backwards. "Why does the banjo make this melody?" ← "Because the
  drum's latent spectrum, under the banjo's structural constraints, yields
  these stable modes." That is ←.

  == 6. THE CIRCLE ← GROUP EXAMPLE ==

  (example-circle-group
    (← circle group)
    (reading "Circle is a stabilized 'return' phenomenon. Group is a
             closure/composition constraint that makes the return coherent.")
    (constraint-schema group (closure composition identity inverse))
    (note "Non-Platonic: 'group' here is a constraint-schema, not a
           realm-object. The group axioms are what ← infers when you
           ask: what constraints make circular return stable?"))

  This is the bridge to futon6's mathematical dictionary: the dictionary
  does not catalog mathematical objects (Platonic reading). It catalogs
  constraint-schemas (← reading): for each mathematical form, what
  constraints make it stable? The five dimensions from Corneli (2014)
  — Context, Feedback, Quality, Structure, Heuristic — are decomposition
  regimes (部) for reading ← across mathematical practice.

  == 7. CONNECTION TO FUTON6: QUESTION-ASKING AS ← ==

  The core claim for futon6:

  (claim
    (asking-good-question A)
    (equals (reverse-morphogenesis A understanding))
    (where
      (A := mathematical-form)
      (understanding := intended-fruit)
      (question := inferred-constraint)))

  A good mathematical question is: given this form (象), and this sense of
  what understanding would be valuable (香), what constraint (question) would
  make the form yield that understanding?

  Bad questions fail at one of three points:
  1. Wrong 象: the form is not well-specified (asking about "infinity" without
     saying which infinity)
  2. Wrong 香: the salience signal is not grounded (asking "why is this
     important?" without a context that makes importance detectable)
  3. Wrong ←: the constraint inference is broken (asking a question whose
     answer would not actually yield the intended understanding)

  The flexiformal pathway (EXPLORE → ASSIMILATE → CANALIZE) maps:
  - EXPLORE = detect 香 (sense what matters, without formalizing)
  - ASSIMILATE = apply ← (infer constraints from form + salience)
  - CANALIZE = stabilize 象 (the constraints become structural, not effortful)

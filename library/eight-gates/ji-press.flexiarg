! conclusion: Apply focused pressure to a specific point; concentrate force rather than dispersing it.
  + context: An agent has identified a leverage point where concentrated attention can shift the situation.
  + IF:
    The situation has a focal point—a constraint, decision, or dependency—where pressure will have outsized effect.
  + HOWEVER:
    Diffuse pressure accomplishes nothing. Pressure on the wrong point wastes energy. The squeeze must be precise and sustained.
  + THEN:
    Identify the point that matters. Apply pressure there and only there. Jǐ is not about overwhelming force but about concentrated attention—squeezing, compressing, pressing on the specific place where the structure can shift. Both hands (or multiple resources) focus on the same point.
  + BECAUSE:
    Patterns have focal tensions—the IF/HOWEVER pair that defines when they apply. Pressing means engaging that specific tension fully rather than addressing the pattern superficially. Compression at the right point releases transformation.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Identify the single most important constraint or decision point.
    - Concentrate resources there rather than spreading attention.
    - Sustain pressure until the point shifts.

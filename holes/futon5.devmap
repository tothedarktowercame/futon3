@factor Concentration (samādhi)
@IFR: FUTON5 operates as the samādhi (concentration) engine, turning improvisation, CT riffs, musical chops, and Nonstarter economics into renewable practices that keep creativity gathered without teleological drag.
@state Design-only plan; prototypes have narrative intent but no running code or artefacts yet.
@next start


! instantiated-by: Prototype 0 — Nonstarter Frame (Concentration without Teleology) [🎶/己 🔥/世]
  + context: FUTON5 is the samādhi layer: gathering energy around chosen patterns, sustaining focus, and refusing the teleology of success so value is created without capture and creativity concentrates without collapse.
  + if: You want a layer that stabilises creative practice (music, coding, argument, CT diagrams) into repeatable, renewable flows.
  + however: Current prototypes (MetaCA, flexiarg, musical studies, CT notes) sit in isolation and do not yet form a concentrated practice ecology.
  + then: Define FUTON5 as the layer where prototypes from F4 are refined into systems—pattern libraries, CT riffs, musical grammars, improvisation logics, Nonstarter economics—so concentrated practice can run independent of outcome-chasing.
  + because: Without a stable concentrator layer, FUTON4’s tranquility and FUTON6’s argument power cannot synergise.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Patterns of Improvisation & Meta-Pattern Formalism [🌲/归 🔃/今]
  + context: Improvisation, category theory, MetaCA, and design patterns exhibit the same structural move: they generate new forms by transforming existing ones. FUTON5 requires not only descriptions of improvisation but *operators* that act on F4/F5 patterns. The target is ~256 core meta-patterns, grounded computationally in the 256 elementary cellular automata—each CA treated as a control feature at the meta level.
  + if: You want FUTON5 to unify musical, mathematical, and symbolic improvisation into a coherent substrate of transformation rules with a formal composition logic.
  + however: Current improvisation notes, CT riffs, musical examples, and MetaCA sketches exist as fragments, not as typed operators that can act on pattern-graphs. No formal pipeline exists from patterns to executable implementations.
  + then: Create a "Patterns of Improvisation" protobook with core operators (e.g., Prototype → Production, Kleisli Turn, Return to I, Phase-Switch, Noise Budget, Concentration Spiral). For each operator:
      • provide a riff (music),
      • a CT sketch (arrow diagram or endofunctor view),
      • a MetaCA local rule mapping grounded in the 256 elementary CA,
      • and define its action on F4/F5 pattern-graphs (input type, output type, invariants preserved, tensions altered).
    Establish the formal pipeline: **patterns → category-theoretic schema → code generation** (via LLM or other methods). This enables executable documentation—the pattern composition *is* the specification that generates implementation.
  + because: These meta-patterns form the FUTON5 "RNA pack": a finite alphabet of transformations grounded in CA control features, with category theory providing the composition rules. The formalism applies reflexively: the stack itself becomes a domain, enabling ongoing self-documentation as the system extends.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1b — Sigil–Operator Lexicon (RNA Bootloader) [🌲/归 👂/络]
  + context: FUTON4 already uses a 256-sigil alphabet to index symbolic states and pattern traces. FUTON5 requires these sigils to index *meta-patterns*—operators that transform F4/F5 pattern-graphs.
  + if: You want a finite, reusable, cross-domain alphabet of improvisational operators (an “RNA table”) that can be invoked by agents, humans, and musical systems.
  + however: Sigils currently tag patterns descriptively but lack operational semantics; no mapping exists between a sigil and the transformation it performs on a pattern-graph.
  + then: Define a minimal operator spec:
       • input type (pattern, riff, argument, or multi-node diagram),  
       • output type (new pattern-graph, mutated pattern, or practice directive),  
       • graph effect (context shift, force modulation, solution re-expression, example migration),  
       • musical / CT / practice phenotype,  
       • collapse modes (misuse, teleology traps).
    Bind 8–12 sigils to the operators defined in Prototype 1 (“Patterns of Improvisation”) to create the first FUTON5 RNA lexicon.  
    Store the mapping in Arxana as editable F5 nodes so that new operators can be added, tuned, or retired.
  + because: Without a sigil-indexed transformation alphabet, FUTON5 lacks executable concentration mechanics. With it, sigils become active operators—an RNA engine capable of transforming DNA-patterns from FUTON4 into living, improvisable forms.


! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Concentration Engine (Chops, Not Goals) [🌲/习 🔥/己]
  + context: Concentration in F5 is about capacity, not outcomes: sustained work on craft (music, CT, code) without dangling the carrot of “success.”
  + if: You want a system for renewable, non-self-punishing discipline.
  + however: Current practice cycles depend heavily on mood, projects, or institutional demands.
  + then: Establish a “Concentration Engine” protocol with 3–5 stable practice grooves (bass technique, CT reading, coding drills, MetaCA tinkering), ensure each groove has low activation energy and clear termination points, and track them in FUTON5 as patterns rather than habits.
  + because: Concentration emerges from rhythm, not obligation.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 3 — Pattern Library (Post-Flexiarg) [💬/世 🐺/归]
  + context: Flexiarg formalises arguments (F6) while FUTON5 formalises patterns.
  + if: You want a domain-agnostic, cross-modal pattern language scaffold that sits between Arxana and the argumentarium.
  + however: Existing patterns are scattered across papers (P4P, P4D, P4NG) and are not harmonised.
  + then: Define a minimal F5 pattern schema (@pattern-id, IF/HOWEVER/THEN/BECAUSE where useful, examples across music/code/CT/life, invariants/failure modes, “improvisation affordances”) and refactor 6–12 core patterns into that schema.
  + because: FUTON5 needs a pattern substrate that can plug directly into FUTON6’s argument logic.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 4 — MetaCA as Improvisation Physics [🔃/己 🔺/今]
  + context: MetaCA is your 2014 prototype of local-rule self-evolution and mirrors your 2025 simulation-based self-understanding.
  + if: You want to reinterpret MetaCA as the “physics” of improvisation: everything evolves locally but is constrained globally by a deep rule (Dhamma / AIF).
  + however: MetaCA code exists, yet its conceptual integration with FUTON5 is not explicit.
  + then: Reframe MetaCA as an F5 conceptual engine where local rules equal riffs/CT arrows/pattern transforms, the global rule embodies AIF, edge-of-chaos represents productive creativity, collapse modes name burnout/ego/overcontrol, and capture this in one short essay inside the F5 devmap.
  + because: This gives FUTON5 a mathematical “feel” that is embodied, generative, and non-institutional.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Nonstarter Social Physics [🎶/己 🔥/无]
  + context: Nonstarter = anti-teleology, refusal of capture, joy in giving, Patti Smith energy, LANDBACK aesthetics.
  + if: You want FUTON5 not only to concentrate craft but to concentrate value without reproducing institutional extraction.
  + however: There is no current model linking creative concentration with non-extractive flows.
  + then: Define a simple Nonstarter Ledger inside F5 that tracks “value given” (hours, riffs, patterns released), “value received” (collaboration, uplift, resonance), enforces a “no-ask posture” protocol, encodes reciprocity loops based on pattern contribution rather than money, and distinguishes RESCUE requests from COLLABORATION requests.
  + because: With a functional Nonstarter economy, FUTON5 becomes spiritually and materially sustainable.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 6 — Improvisation Metrics (Not KPIs) [🚞/叉 🌲/己]
  + context: Metrics destroy creativity when tied to teleology.
  + if: You want a way to sense concentration without collapsing into institutional logic.
  + however: No metrics currently track musical, cognitive, or conceptual “chops.”
  + then: Define a set of “Improvisation Indicators” (Noise Budget, Flow Duration, Surprise-to-Stability Ratio, Return-to-I Coherence, Cross-Domain Lift between music/writing/coding) and track them qualitatively in F5 without gamification.
  + because: FUTON5 needs feedback, not surveillance.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 7 — F4⇄F5⇄F6 Conduction Pathways [👐/么 🔥/己]
  + context: F4 is tranquility, F6 is war machine, and F5 is the samādhi bridge.
  + if: You want to flow smoothly between relaxed inscription (F4), concentrated craft (F5), and structured reasoning (F6).
  + however: There is no explicit pathway linking the three.
  + then: Define three conduction modes—F4→F5 (prototype → practice, what to work on today), F5→F6 (practice → argument, what becomes a formal insight), F6→F5 (argument → pattern, what needs to be embodied)—and document these flows as short “transmission patterns.”
  + because: Without conduction, the stack fragments instead of concentrating.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 8 — Demonstrated Transfer Milestone [🔃/桥 🔺/另]
  + context: The meta-pattern formalism claims that patterns developed in one domain can transfer to another. This claim must be validated, not just asserted.
  + if: You want confidence that FUTON5's approach is real rather than just well-specified.
  + however: No concrete demonstration yet shows a pattern developed for (e.g.) ant simulation actually working when applied to cellular automata control, music, or another domain.
  + then: Select 2-3 patterns from the core set, develop them fully in one domain (e.g., ants or MetaCA), then apply them to a different domain (e.g., musical improvisation or crowdfunding) and document whether they work, fail, or require adaptation. Record the results as evidence for or against the transfer thesis.
  + because: A key milestone for FUTON5's plausibility is demonstrating that patterns developed in one domain actually transfer to another—not just that they can be written, but that they work.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 9 — 12-Prototype Year (Concentration Arc) [🌲/末 🌽/己]
  + context: You are already running a 12-prototype year.
  + if: You want FUTON5 to shape it into a concentration arc rather than a sequence of builds.
  + however: There is no formal mapping of prototypes to F5 themes.
  + then: Assign each prototype a concentration domain (MetaCA, Patterns of Improvisation, CT chops, Musical chops, Flexiarg → pattern transforms, Nonstarter ledger, Pattern economy, F5 system interfaces, Meta-Improvisation, AIF integration, Relational improvisation patterns, Year-end coherence synthesis) and keep the map current as the year unfolds.
  + because: Concentration deepens through cyclical return.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 10 — Yearly F5 Review (Concentration Renewal) [🌅/已 🌲/己]
  + context: Concentration weakens if not refreshed.
  + if: You want F5 to stay light, concentrated, and improvisational rather than dogmatic.
  + however: Without review, patterns accrete into heaviness.
  + then: Run a yearly cycle that prunes dead patterns, refines musical grammars, updates CT riffs, consolidates improvisation patterns, refreshes the Nonstarter ethos, and removes anything that smells like KPIs.
  + because: Concentration equals aliveness, and aliveness must be renewed.

! conclusion:
  Recognise that a sub-£50k request is proportional because the work limits
  itself to methodological evaluation (annotation + seminars) on top of the
  existing MUSN transport stack.

  + IF:
    Job-argument and transformation-engine patterns already show how we cost
    short bursts of research that reuse infrastructure.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without a clear ledger of what the money buys (specialist annotation, light
    AI usage, seminar facilitation), the request looks speculative.

  + THEN:
    Itemise costs around part-time researchers (including time to draft
    annotation guidelines and run inter-annotator checks), limited compute, and
    discussion convening; cite the MUSN pilot artefacts as in-kind
    infrastructure.

  + BECAUSE:
    Reviewers need to see that funds unlock evaluation, not platform rebuilds.

! conclusion: talk4real delivers added value by supplying replicable infrastructural DNA that universities and disciplines can use to build a federated commons for adaptive governance. [🧬/义 🌐/土]
  + because: Ten linked doctoral projects—talk4maths, talk4health, talk4policy, talk4arts, and others—test the same REPL architecture in different domains.
  + therefore: Each project contributes stories, datasets, and tools to an evolving commons that lets institutions reflect collectively.
  + illustrates: The Supplement already demonstrates cross-voice dialogue, thematic tagging, consent protocols, and reflective synthesis working as a live prototype.
  + therefore: Universities gain a practical method for adaptive governance, and the wider field gains a way to study and iteratively improve epistemic systems.

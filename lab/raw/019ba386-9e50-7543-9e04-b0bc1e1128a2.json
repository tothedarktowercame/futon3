Use the stack-coherence patterns (e.g. `stack-blocker-detection`) to spot empty dirs or missing artifacts and record `blocked-by[...]` until the prerequisite is done.\n- Watch for repeated sigil pairs in devmaps. The pattern library (e.g. `pattern-differentiation-alarms`) treats duplicates as alarms: either split\/merge the underlying patterns, add a more specific devmap-coherence flexiarg, or retire stale clauses. After adjustments, rerun the TF\u2013IDF embedding + sigil matrices so the fake embedding stays meaningful.\n- Contribute new stack-coherence patterns whenever the project needs cross-futon checks (e.g. comparing READMEs vs git logs). These global patterns should inspect hotspots\u2014git history, README timestamps, file trees\u2014to classify each devmap item as \u201cdone \/ blocked \/ drifting\u201d and help the informal proof engine keep the whole stack honest.\n\n## MUSN stuff\n\nF2 (MUSN) \u2014 One-Page Build Brief\n\nScope (thin waist): Transport + routing only.

Keep them gentle by supplying\n`ERT_SELECTOR` (e.g., `ERT_SELECTOR='futon3-prototype-*'`) and, when running everything, consider\n`ulimit -v 2097152` to avoid GUI Emacs OOMs.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: \/home\/joe\/.codex\/skills\/.system\/skill-creator\/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME\/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: \/home\/joe\/.codex\/skills\/.system\/skill-installer\/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing\/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references\/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts\/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets\/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n<\/INSTRUCTIONS>"},{"id":"019ba386-9e50-7543-9e04-b0bc1e1128a2:u002","timestamp":"2026-01-09T16:11:07.248Z","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>\/home\/joe\/code\/futon3<\/cwd>\n  <approval_policy>never<\/approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write<\/sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted<\/network_access>\n  <shell>bash<\/shell>\n<\/environment_context>"},{"id":"019ba386-9e50-7543-9e04-b0bc1e1128a2:u003","timestamp":"2026-01-09T16:11:07.248Z","text":"---FULAB-HUD---\nIntent: Demo HUD attach\nSigils: \ud83c\udf6f\/\u4e49 \ud83d\udcb1\/\u7ecf \ud83e\uddea\/\u5f8b\n\nPattern candidates (reason about these):\n1. vsatlas\/economic-resonance-layer (score: 0.00)\n   \"Allow emergent clusters to attach lightweight economic tools (mutual aid, microcredit, resource maps) to relational arcs.\"\n2. stack-coherence\/futon1-determinism (score: 0.00)\n   \"rely on the `Futon1 Deterministic Stack` GitHub Action (`futon1\/.github\/workflows\/futon1-stack-tests.yml`) or run the suites manually (`cd futon1\/apps\/client && clojure -M:test`, `cd apps\/graph-memory && clojure -M:test -m cognitect.test-runner`, `cd apps\/nlp-interface && clojure -M:test`).

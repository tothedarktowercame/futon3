! conclusion:
  A mathematical proof is a sequence of social-computational moves that can
  be coded along five dimensions: context, feedback, quality, structure, and
  heuristic. This coding bridges human reasoning and agent behavior.

  + context: You are validating that the pattern tagger and agent system can
    analyse proofs in the same way the Corneli (2014) thesis Appendix B analyses
    them by hand.
  + IF:
      Appendix B of the thesis codes two proofs (Gowers & Ganesalingam, 2012) using
      a 5-category scheme: (1) context — expand definitions, scope the problem;
      (2) feedback — generate examples, try instances; (3) quality — form conjectures,
      build models; (4) structure — change descriptions, apply deductions;
      (5) heuristic — restrict to known, certify results.

  + HOWEVER:
      The thesis coding was done by hand on two proofs. Scaling to corpus-level
      requires automation. The 25 math-informal patterns partially cover the 5
      categories but were not designed to partition cleanly into them. Some patterns
      span multiple categories; some categories lack dedicated patterns.

  + THEN:
      Map each of the 25 math-informal patterns to one or more of the 5 thesis
      categories. Identify coverage gaps: categories where no pattern fires
      reliably. Use the Appendix B worked examples as test cases for the pattern
      tagger — do the automatically assigned patterns match the hand-coded categories?
      This is a unit test for the entire pattern-tagging enterprise.

  + BECAUSE:
      If the pattern tagger's output aligns with the hand-coded proof analysis, it
      validates both the tagger and the thesis's claim that proofs are structured
      social-computational processes. If it doesn't align, the gap tells us exactly
      which reasoning moves the tagger misses.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Create a 25×5 mapping matrix: each pattern assigned to thesis categories (1)-(5).]
    next[Run pattern tagger on the two Appendix B proofs (if available in corpus) and compare with hand coding.]
    next[Identify thesis categories with thin pattern coverage; consider whether new patterns are needed.]

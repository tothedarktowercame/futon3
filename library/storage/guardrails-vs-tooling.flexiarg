! conclusion:
  if you want internal tooling but also strong guardrails, force internal writers through the same authorization and invariant checks

  + context: futon1 hardened penholder checks and charon guards after internal writer bypass risks.
  + IF:
    you want convenient internal scripts and writers

  + HOWEVER:
    you also need authorization and invariant enforcement to be universal

  + THEN:
    route internal writers through the same guardrails as external API calls

  + BECAUSE:
    bypass vectors appear when internal tooling skips guards

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]

    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L139]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add guard enforcement tests for internal scripts and batch ingests.]
    next[Document required penholder context for every writer entry point.]

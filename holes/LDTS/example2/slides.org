* Slide 1: INPUT — Identity
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_class: slide
:END:

** Core Claim
A successful repository transition must begin where we *are*.

** Identity-Field (Inputs)
- Brookes values:
  - *Inclusivity* — an environment where all are valued and supported  
  - *Confidence* — trust in people, preparation for impact  
  - *Enterprising creativity* — adaptability, flexible problem-solving  
  - *Connectedness* — learning by doing, active engagement  
  - *Generosity of spirit* — sharing knowledge and supporting the community
- Role × value invariants (low-friction, non-punitive, visible credit)
- Stakeholder identities (researchers, ORCAs, IT, governance)
- Repository identity: a “market stall” for Brookes research within the wider community

** Diagnostic Insight
- Dysfunction arises when *identity* and *infrastructure* drift apart.
- Distorted patterns: heroics, workarounds, tacit dependencies, fragmentation.
- REF risk often surfaces precisely at these drift points.

** Input Summary
Identity defines the constraints of any credible transformation.


* Slide 2: OUTPUT — Capability
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_class: slide
:END:

** Core Claim
The purpose of the repository is to *extend* institutional capability.

** REF People, Culture & Environment — Capability Frame
- *Strategy* — sustaining a healthy research culture  
- *Responsibility* — integrity, ethics, transparency  
- *Connectivity* — interdisciplinarity and open research  
- *Inclusivity* — an accessible, equitable environment  
- *Development* — valuing diverse research roles and pathways

** What Capability Looks Like in Practice
- More authors and artefacts represented (Strategy / Connectivity)
- More consistent metadata; clearer governance loops (Responsibility)
- Lower operational risk; fewer bottlenecks (Responsibility / Strategy)
- Less heroic labour; better-aligned workflows (Development)
- Higher researcher trust and visibility (Inclusivity / Connectivity)

** Capability as Constructed Object
A repository is not “new software” —  
it is the *operational expression* of identity and a primary mechanism  
for delivering REF PCE capability.

** Output Summary
Capability is the accumulated, operationalised form of identity.


* Slide 3: PROCESS — Iterative Projection
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_class: slide
:END:

** Core Claim
Identity → projection → capability is not a procedural loop —
it is a *patterned* leadership cycle.

** How the Cycle Actually Works

1. /Identity/ (Brookes values, REF duties, stakeholder principles)
   - *Compatibility Mapping:* Identity surfaces which units resonate and how.  
   - *Worldshape Sensitivity:* Different domains inhabit different constraint-spaces  
     (IT architecture, REF audit logic, governance risk, researcher autonomy).  
   - *Boundary Stewardship:* Identity defines professional freedoms that must be protected.

2. /Projection/ (small, resonant forward moves)
   - *Learning Rhythms:* Projections must fit team learning modes  
     (real-time loops for librarians/RDM; asynchronous loops for researchers/IT).
   - *Modes of Connection:* Projections must meet collaborators where they connect:  
     task • care • practice • mission.

3. /Capability/ (minimal infrastructure that makes it real)
   - Pattern-aligned capability reduces bottlenecks, risk, and over-reliance on heroics.  
   - Each cycle stabilises new patterns in practice, deepening capability over time.

4. /Iterate/ (lightweight, worldshape-aware pacing)
   - Compatibility, rhythm, boundaries, and connection modes are retuned each cycle.
   - This is how institutions change without rupture.

** Counter-Stawman (Good Process)
- No monolithic reset  
- No hero software choice  
- Pattern-led iteration  
- Small, testable commitments  

** Process Summary
The transformation engine runs *because* of the patterns:
compatibility, rhythm, worldshape, boundaries, and connection.
This is how Brookes grows capability safely over time.

** One-Sentence Conclusion
A repository transition is best led using a lightweight, patterned
*identity → projection → capability* process — a proof by construction.

! conclusion: 用單一門面對複雜子系統提供穩定入口。
  + context: A subsystem exposes many low-level calls that are hard to orchestrate.
  + if: You want a simple, stable entry point without exposing internal complexity.
  + however: Letting callers assemble the sequence leads to duplicated orchestration and fragile workflows.
  + then: Create a facade that bundles the common orchestration into one high-level interface.
  + because: A stable facade shields callers from churn in underlying components.
  + next-steps:
    - Define a minimal surface and keep the facade free of business policy; push policy to a dedicated layer.
    - evidence-shape: {:facade/name :string, :facade/entrypoints [:string], :facade/deps [:string]}

! conclusion: Require each score term to declare the observation channels and precision settings it consumed.
  + context: A pattern-guided agent evaluates candidates with a multi-term expected free energy score built from heterogeneous evidence.
  + IF:
    You want tuning decisions and failures to be diagnosable at the level of which evidence actually drove each score term.
  + HOWEVER:
    Without explicit traceability, terms like risk or ambiguity silently absorb whatever signals are available, making post-hoc explanations indistinguishable from rationalization.
  + THEN:
    Require every G term contribution to declare the observation keys it consumed, the precision channels applied, and the intermediate values used to compute that term, and persist this mapping alongside the score.
  + BECAUSE:
    Explicit term-to-channel linkage prevents semantic drift in scoring terms and makes policy behavior mechanically inspectable.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Log term provenance for the top-K candidate actions per step.
    - Review whether the same observation channels dominate a term, which can indicate mis-specified precision rather than genuine signal.

! conclusion: talk4real reimagines doctoral training as a shared experimental learning infrastructure that continually refines itself through reflexive, collective practice. [🏡/工 🔃/入]
  + because: Most doctoral programmes operate within disciplinary or thematic silos.
    + therefore: These silos engage minimally with learning beyond their boundaries and contribute little to improving practice at system level.
  + because: Collective-intelligence frameworks can capture feedback between researchers, institutions, and communities.
    + therefore: Embedding these feedback loops allows research systems to learn from their own activity.
    + instantiated-by: talk4real applies a REPL-style cycle—read, evaluate, print, loop—to social and epistemic processes.
      + clarifies: This cycle links ethnography, computational analysis, design, and collective reflection.
    ? example: Related precedents include initiatives such as realtalk@MIT, PlanetMath.org, and Peeragogy.
    ? example(optional): Insert 1–2 current, funder-recognisable exemplars of collective-intelligence infrastructure.
  + therefore: We will run coordinated doctoral projects that instantiate the same learning architecture in distinct domains.
    + therefore: Each doctoral scholar becomes both a researcher and an agent of collective intelligence.
  + underpinned-by: The model is structured by three design principles.
    + specifies: Ethical reflexivity—participants co-author their representation.
    + specifies: Lightweight infrastructure—the method is portable and not locked to heavy platforms.
    + specifies: Polyphonic governance—multiple voices are synthesised, not averaged away.

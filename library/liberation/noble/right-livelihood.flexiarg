! conclusion: Not avoiding-wrong-livelihood but the desisting itself — the abstaining, abstinence, and refraining from wrong livelihood operating as factor of path in one intent on the undefiled.
  + context: This operates in one developing the noble path. It is "the desisting, abstaining, abstinence, and refraining from wrong livelihood" — the faculty of livelihood-restraint itself, functioning cleanly.
  + IF:
    Even skillful livelihood involves an earner — one who takes credit for ethical earning, who is proud of avoiding harmful trades. The ethical livelihood can become another source of identity.
  + HOWEVER:
    Material life continues — the question is whether livelihood flows from identification with security or from the path functioning.
  + THEN:
    Noble right livelihood is the abstaining faculty operating in context of the path — the natural refraining from wrong livelihood that arises when one is oriented toward liberation rather than security. Not "I earn ethically" but ethical earning as expression of path.
  + BECAUSE:
    Livelihood is the most sustained form of action — it shapes daily life hour by hour. When this sustained pattern becomes transparent to path-factors, everyday activity becomes practice.
  + TRANSCENDENT-QUALITY:
    - Not "I don't engage in wrong livelihood" but clean earning as path-expression
    - Material life that neither grasps at security nor avoids responsibility
    - Livelihood transparent to wisdom
    - Work that is offering rather than acquiring
  + THE-RUNNING-CIRCLE:
    "Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness keep running and circling around right livelihood" — understanding wrong and right livelihood (view), working to abandon wrong and cultivate right (effort), doing so mindfully.
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-MUNDANE:
    Mundane: "I earn by right livelihood" (an I earning)
    Noble: The abstaining faculty operating, intent on the undefiled
  + WORN-AWAY:
    "For one of right livelihood, wrong livelihood is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong livelihood are worn away."
  + NOTE:
    This is the last factor described as encompassed by right view, effort, and mindfulness. The final three (effort, mindfulness, concentration) are self-evidently involved.

! conclusion:
  Introduce a purpose-built object that mediates between what you have and what you need.

  + context: You have a hypothesis and a conclusion, but no direct path between them.
  + IF:
      The gap between hypothesis and conclusion is structural: you need an intermediate
      object (a function, a sequence, a set, a morphism) that does not appear in the
      problem statement but whose existence would bridge the gap.

  + HOWEVER:
      Auxiliary objects can feel like magic when encountered for the first time. The skill
      is in recognising which construction is needed: truncation, mollification, partition
      of unity, Hahn-Banach extension, free object on generators, approximating sequence.

  + THEN:
      Identify the gap. Ask: what kind of object would connect my hypothesis to my
      conclusion? Construct it explicitly. Verify it has the properties needed on both
      sides. Common auxiliary objects include: truncated random variables, bump functions,
      test morphisms, approximating sequences, and free resolutions.

  + BECAUSE:
      Many of the most important proofs in mathematics turn on a single clever auxiliary
      construction. The Radon-Nikodym derivative, the partition of unity, the resolvent
      operator — these are all auxiliary objects that became standard tools precisely
      because they bridge common structural gaps.

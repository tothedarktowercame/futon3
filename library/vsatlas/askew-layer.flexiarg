! conclusion:
  Add an interpretive “askew” layer where contributors propose arcs, passages, and conceptual bridges without modifying originals.

  + context: You are designing a narrative system where contributors can explore interpretations and relationships without altering canonical stories, preserving authorial integrity while enabling sense-making.
  + IF:
    Canonical stories must be preserved yet contributors need room to explore relations.

  + HOWEVER:
    Forcing links into the canonical layer violates narrative sovereignty and breeds incoherence.

  + THEN:
    Add an interpretive “askew” layer where contributors propose arcs, passages, and conceptual bridges without modifying originals.

  + BECAUSE:
    Interpretive overlays let relational meaning emerge while protecting authorial integrity.

! conclusion:
  The xenotype makes Baldwin cycles themselves portable. The same
  generate-select-compress skeleton can be reused at different interfaces,
  turning cross-layer gain from accidental tuning into replicable structure.

  + context: If we only have genotype↔phenotype, we get one-off engineering
    history. Introducing xenotype means the Baldwin cycle itself becomes a
    transplantable structure, applicable across different substrates.

  + XENOTYPE-COMPONENTS:
    A xenotype provides three portable mechanisms:

    1. GENERATOR: Proposes variants within constraints
       - Given exotype, produce candidate genotype changes
       - Examples: mutation operators, variation samplers, rule combiners

    2. SELECTOR: Scores variants against evidence/invariants
       - Given phenotype outcomes, rank candidates
       - Examples: fitness functions, invariant checkers, metric comparers

    3. COMPRESSOR: Extracts rules/patterns from success
       - Given successful variants, produce minimal genotype
       - Examples: pattern miners, rule simplifiers, invariant tighteners

  + PORTABILITY-ACROSS-LAYERS:
    Same adapt→assimilate→canalize module works at:
    - CA rule layer (generate rule variants, select by behavior, compress)
    - Message bus layer (generate routing variants, select by throughput)
    - Data schema layer (generate schema variants, select by query perf)
    - UI/command layer (generate interaction variants, select by usability)

  + TRANSPLANTATION-PROTOCOL:
    To apply xenotype X at interface I:
    1. Instantiate X.generator with I's exotype constraints
    2. Bind X.selector to I's success metrics
    3. Connect X.compressor to I's genotype representation
    4. Run Baldwin cycle with X driving generate-select-compress

  + WHY-XENOTYPE-MATTERS:
    Without xenotype: Each interface reinvents adaptation machinery
    With xenotype: One adaptation skeleton, many instantiations

    The xenotype is why "learning to learn" is possible - the learning
    mechanism itself becomes portable structure.

  + RELATIONSHIP-TO-FUTON-THEORY:
    - Xenotype portability enables: Same patterns drive different layers
    - Evidence accumulation: Xenotype improvements benefit all interfaces
    - Proof paths: Xenotype instantiation is itself a traceable operation

  + EXAMPLE-XENOTYPE:
    VariationalSearch xenotype:
    - Generator: Sample from prior, apply variation operator
    - Selector: Score against loss function + invariant checks
    - Compressor: Gradient-based or symbolic simplification

    Applicable to: CA rules, API parameters, schema migrations, etc.

  + BECAUSE:
    The xenotype names why cross-layer gains compound. Without it, each
    layer's improvements are isolated. With it, improvements to the
    adaptation mechanism benefit all layers that use it.

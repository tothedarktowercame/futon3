! conclusion: Frame governance work in proof-adjacent language so it is legible to formal-methods interlocutors.
  + context: You are considering re-entering the ethical AI space, and want your work understood as operational infrastructure for LLM-assisted reasoning.
  + IF:
    You want to communicate your work as a missing cognitive governance layer so it is legible to serious practitioners and potential employers.
  + HOWEVER:
    If you frame it as generic AI ethics or a broad personal framework, it will be interpreted as compliance theater or idiosyncratic worldview.
  + THEN:
    Anchor the story in a concrete governance gap in LLM-assisted reasoning, route it through formal-methods-aligned interlocutors using proof-adjacent language (assumptions, traceability, failure modes, audit trails), and include one or two crisp examples.
  + BECAUSE:
    Formal-methods sensibilities provide shared criteria for good reasoning infrastructure, making the pattern layer legible as operational governance.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Select 2-3 recent artifacts where patterns constrained LLM work.
    - Draft a one-paragraph governance gap statement with one concrete example and test it with a trusted interlocutor.

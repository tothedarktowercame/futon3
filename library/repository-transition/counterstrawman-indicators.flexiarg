! conclusion: Emporium Indicators (meaningful signals for an outward-facing repository)

  + because: The repository functions as an emporium (showcase of research assets),
    + indicator: Footfall — volume and diversity of external visitors, not raw downloads.
    + indicator: Portfolio views — depth of exploration across interdisciplinary areas.
    + indicator: Exposure outside the university — citations, shares, invitations.
    + indicator: Partnership inquiries — conversions into collaborations or revenue.
    + indicator: Cross-unit usage — evidence that internal groups use each other’s assets.

  + because: The emporium must be accountable to internal stakeholders,
    + indicator: Deposit friction — time-to-deposit, error rate, staff support load.
    + indicator: Rights clarity — number of items with clear reuse permissions.
    + indicator: Curation throughput — number of showcased items with editorial framing.
    + indicator: Inclusion signal — proportion of outputs from under-represented groups.

  + therefore: These indicators become the evidence loop for whether identity
               preservation is translating into visible, outward-facing capability.

! conclusion:
  Every change in the FUTON stack follows a proof path: an auditable event chain
  linking intent to operation to change to verification to durable proof commit.

  + context: The proof path is the core unit of work in futon theory. It embodies
    the Curry-Howard correspondence: programs are proofs of their specifications.

  + AXIOM-GROUNDING:
    A1 (Auditability): Every proof path is fully traceable from intent to outcome.
    A2 (Attributability): Each event in the path has a clear source and owner.
    A3 (Evidence-driven): Progression requires verified evidence, not assertion.

  + STRUCTURE:
    A proof path consists of these phases:
    1. CLOCK_IN - Session begins, agent declares intent
    2. OBSERVE - Read state, gather evidence
    3. PROPOSE_CLAIM - Agent proposes what will change
    4. APPLY_CHANGE - Execute the change
    5. VERIFY - Confirm change matches claim
    6. INVARIANT_CHECK - All invariants must pass
    7. PROOF_COMMIT - Durable commit with evidence chain
    8. CLOCK_OUT - Session ends, proof path complete

  + INVARIANTS:
    - No change commits without passing all invariant checks
    - Every commit references its evidence chain
    - Proof paths are append-only; errors spawn new paths, not mutations

  + BECAUSE:
    Without proof paths, changes are unauditable. With them, any bug can be
    traced from symptom to cause through the evidence chain. The spec mediates
    future state into present; the proof path is how we get there defensibly.

  + IMPLEMENTATION:
    `futon3/lab/session.clj`: Session lifecycle wraps proof paths
    `futon1/core/xtdb.clj`: Durable commits implement PROOF_COMMIT phase
    `futon3/checks/`: Check DSL verifies claims against evidence

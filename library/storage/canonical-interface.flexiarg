! conclusion:
  expose a minimal, stable HTTP interface as the canonical way to query and update the persistent store without internal coupling

  + context: futon1’s devmap defines the HTTP API as the canonical interface for external tools.
  + IF:
    external tools must query/update storage without embedding internals

  + HOWEVER:
    unstable interfaces force clients to copy internal assumptions or scrape CLI output

  + THEN:
    keep a documented HTTP surface as the primary contract for persistence operations

  + BECAUSE:
    canonical interfaces let higher futons depend on storage without tight coupling

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L29]
    evidence[holes/futon1.devmap#L33]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define the minimal API surface for futon1a and its evolution protocol.]
    next[Add compatibility tests to ensure response stability across versions.]

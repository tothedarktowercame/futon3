! conclusion: talk4real’s supervisory and training model turns the cohort into a distributed research operating system that learns how learning itself can be designed. [👭/友 👥/序]
  + context: You are describing how supervision and training uphold the shared REPL method.
  + IF:
    The cohort needs a common protocol to keep projects aligned.
  + HOWEVER:
    Dispersed supervision can fragment practice and standards.
  + THEN:
    Anchor training in shared rituals and artefacts that keep learning collective.
  + BECAUSE:
    Supervision is collaborative and polyphonic, pairing disciplinary mentors with methodological companions in ethnography, data science, and design.
    Training follows the shared REPL rhythm demonstrated in the Supplement, grounding every project in a common protocol.
    Cohort practices such as listening clinics and signal-boost workshops share data, analyse overlaps, and co-design interventions.
    Portfolio assessment with open datasets, code notebooks, design artefacts, and open peer review makes each scholar a co-investigator refining the collective infrastructure.

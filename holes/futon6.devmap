@factor Equanimity (upekkhā)
@IFR: FUTON6 is the “mathematical habitat” layer of the stack: the place where
mathematics becomes inhabitable by humans and agents through a pattern-indexed,
flexiformal, open-ended dictionary. It draws verified argumentation from FUTON3;
structural memory from FUTON1; and provides the conceptual terrain for FUTON7’s
civic-scale reasoning. F6 is the **pattern-city of mathematics**, not the
execution engine (F3) nor the editing environment (F4).
@state Design-only vision; no dedicated HDM code or imports exist yet beyond conceptual outlines.
@next start

! instantiated-by: Prototype 0 — FUTON6 Frame & Charter [👎/仍 💬/么]
  + context: F6 names the HDM layer: the place where mathematical content,
    scholia, and argument patterns live as shared habitat.
  + if: A crisp scope is needed so HDM does not dissolve into "general aspiration."
  + however: Current F6 references still blur its role with F3 execution and F4 editing.
  + then: Write the F6 charter: (1) remit, (2) neighbours (F3/F4/F5),
    (3) responsibilities (stewardship of content, scholia, pattern indexing),
    (4) non-responsibilities (checking = F3; tooling = F4).
    Note: Via Curry-Howard, the same machinery could in principle extend to programs (proofs = programs), but this is explicitly deferred to avoid swallowing everything prematurely. F6's scope is mathematical knowledge; code-as-proof is a conceptually adjacent but separate concern.
  + because: A charter stabilises FUTON's cascade and prevents scope creep.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Pattern/Proof Bridge [👎/已 💬/氏]
  + context: F3 handles flexiarg, proof trails, and pattern canonicalisation.
  + if: F6 should receive arguments in a stable, machine-tractable form.
  + however: F6 currently implies it must “perform” canonicalisation.
  + then: Define a simple import contract: `check → f6-node`, which lifts checked
    arguments from F3 into the HDM, attaching math metadata but not re-checking.
  + because: This respects the separation of powers (F3 = execution; F6 = habitat).

! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Fruits/Orbs as Math-Annotators [🍍/办 🔸/十]
  + context: F3 annotates flexiform arguments with fruits and pāramitā orbs.
  + if: F6 wants to preserve narrative weight in math-native form.
  + however: No mapping exists from fruit/orb → math-role (lemma, axiom, strategy).
  + then: Define a light translation layer: e.g. 🍍→ indicator lemma; 🗝️→ axiom; 
    🍁→ strategic move; 🐉→ nontrivial dependence. F6 stores these tags but
    does not manage the fruit system itself.
  + because: It preserves argumentative salience without overextending F6.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 3 — Hyperreal Dictionary Seedbed [🔸/小 💬/今]
  + context: HDM’s mission is to build inhabitable mathematics, not abstract criteria.
  + if: F6 needs a concrete minimal slice to prove viability.
  + however: No seed slice or exemplars have been frozen.
  + then: Choose a coherent seed domain (e.g. compactness patterns in MSC26, basic
    categorical arrows, Abelian groups, Dirichlet distributions) and create linked
    entries: definitions, examples, small proofs, scholia, code.
  + because: A tangible neighbourhood demonstrates HDM’s inhabitable promise.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 4 — Layer-3 Reasoning Patterns [💬/乃 🔺/今]
  + context: HDM is the choreography of mathematical moves, not just a pile of entries.
  + if: FUTON6 needs a vocabulary of cross-domain reasoning idioms (quotient tricks,
    local->global moves, dualisation, extremisation) so agents can navigate strategy.
  + however: No curated Layer-3 catalogue exists, so every entry re-invents its own
    outline language.
  + then: Freeze a small but expandable L3 pattern set, tag the seed domain entries
    with those moves, and expose L3 IDs to F6-aware agents as their default reasoning
    vocabulary.
  + because: L3 patterns supply the “physics” of mathematical reasoning and make HDM
    truly traversable.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Layer-4 Domain Patterns [🔺/今 👉/乃]
  + context: Subject areas (MSC slices) have canonical machinery—ultrafilters,
    Yoneda, compact operators, Markov kernels—that sit between general motifs and
    specific entries.
  + if: FUTON6 needs Layer-4 pattern nodes that capture domain-specific constructs,
    typical lemmas, and dependencies.
  + however: Today those structures are either flattened into individual entries or
    treated as vague generalities.
  + then: Identify 10-20 L4 candidates for the seed slice, represent each as a node
    with domain metadata, canonical usages, and referenced L3 moves, and ensure L4
    nodes refactor like any other content.
  + because: L4 patterns provide the local physics that make each mathematical
    neighbourhood habitable.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 6 — L3<->L4 Relation Map [👉/田 🔺/今]
  + context: FUTON6 spans HDM motifs, L3 reasoning physics, L4 domain machinery,
    and concrete entries.
  + if: Imports and viewers need an explicit handshake so layers do not blur.
  + however: No rulebook specifies how L3 motifs embed in L4 constructs or how L4
    clusters point back to universal moves.
  + then: Publish the relation: L3 = field-independent moves, L4 = field-dependent
    machinery; require new entries to declare which layer they instantiate, and build
    viewers showing the L3<->L4 wiring for any definition, proof, or example.
  + because: A fractal, Alexanderian cascade keeps FUTON6 coherent as it scales.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 7 — HDM Dojo Mode [🌀/习 🐴/无]
  + context: Mathematics becomes native when practiced like a dojo: progressive
    disclosure, sparring partners, and navigable landscapes. The goal is not just formal validity but *teachable, understandable proofs*—capturing the pedagogical path, not just the logical structure.
  + if: FUTON6 is to turn math into a habitable habitat for humans and agents, with proofs that are self-documenting and constructing agents gain assurance of correctness.
  + however: Current assets are static entries; they do not yet function as a training
    ground that links moves, contexts, views, and guidance. Proofs may be valid but not teachable.
  + then: Blend L3/L4 tagging with scholium landscapes, progressive outline->detail
    modes, and agent sparring protocols so users can practice reasoning moves inside
    HDM itself. Ensure that proof structure captures both formal validity and informal scaffolding—the design patterns for how proofs are constructed, making them teachable and understandable.
  + because: Mathematical fluency emerges from embodied practice, not passive
    reading. The dojo keeps HDM alive and ensures that proofs are not just correct but comprehensible—agents constructing proofs gain assurance not just of validity but of teachability.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 8 — Scholium & Proof-Landscape Mode [🙅/无 🐲/久]
  + context: F3 emits proof trails; F1 provides graph memory.
  + if: F6 wants users/agents to traverse mathematics as connected terrain.
  + however: No math-specific landscape viewer exists.
  + then: Add scholium metadata (e.g. related lemmas, commentary nodes,
    viewpoint shifts) and render “neighbourhoods”: clusters of results,
    arguments, patterns, counterexamples.
  + because: Landscapes differentiate HDM from a static encyclopedia.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 9 — Language ⇄ Math Transformations [💬/匀 🍍/卡]
  + context: F6 aspires to maintain both NL-friendly and math-native views.
  + if: You want consistent transformations across entries.
  + however: NL ↔ math translations are currently ad hoc.
  + then: Define several translation templates for the seed domain (e.g.,
    “definition block”, “example pattern”, “lemma skeleton”) and exercise them
    with FUTON3’s flexigrammar.
  + because: Even partial bilingualism greatly improves usability.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 10 — Math-Aware Agent Protocol [🙅/无 🍍/工]
  + context: F6 will eventually host agents that annotate, refactor, or query entries.
  + if: You want safe and productive agent behaviour.
  + however: The current protocol is conflated with F3’s checking API.
  + then: Define an F6-specific protocol: allowed queries (definitions, pattern IDs,
    dependency graphs), acceptable outputs (annotations, reorganisations),
    and guardrails (no overwriting canonical entries without review).
  + because: Math-literate agents are central to HDM-as-habitat.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 11 — Non-Capture Guardrails [🔦/开 🌞/公]
  + context: HDM inherits the “war machine” mandate: remain non-state, non-enclosed.
  + if: F6 is to remain an open mathematical habitat.
  + however: Capture risks (institutional, corporate, epistemic) are unarticulated.
  + then: Publish a Non-Capture Charter specifying: open licensing, provenance
    transparency, anti-proprietary entanglement, dual-representation redundancy.
    Mark entries whose sources impose constraints.
  + because: Commons integrity is crucial for HDM’s long-term survival.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 12 — F6⇄F7 Scenarios [🔸/小 🐊/引]
  + context: FUTON7 builds civic imaginaries and long-range scenarios.
  + if: Math should inform F7, not remain siloed.
  + however: There is no pipeline from HDM entries to F7 narratives.
  + then: Package small argument bundles (e.g. growth/decay patterns, 
    equilibrium models, scaling laws) as exportable F6→F7 kits.
  + because: Mathematics should feed collective imagination, not remain inert.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 13 — FLEX Training Ground Link [🚢/未 💬/氏]
  + context: F3 now ships the “Flexiformal Training Ground.”
  + if: F6 wants stewards who know how to handle patterns and proofs.
  + however: F6 does not yet reference this training layer.
  + then: In onboarding docs, require that new math agents/humans pass the F3
    training ground. Capture their trails and store them as scholium notes
    attached to early entries.
  + because: This closes the developmental loop and ensures quality control.

! instantiated-by: Timebox the Core (Agent-Facing)'
  + context: An agent is operating within fixed-duration collaborative sessions.
  + if: The agent attempts to complete a full inquiry loop.
  + however: Feedback indicates saturation or overload before completion.
  + then: Re-focus dynamically on the core loop, complete a concise iteration, and earmark unresolved deeper insights for a follow-up session.
  + because: Efficiency in the moment and depth deferred preserves flow without sacrificing insight.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Timebox variants in agile software recognise deferred deep-dive cycles as a productivity safeguard.
    - Workshop simulations show that capturing “carryover insights” improves longitudinal learning.

! instantiated-by: Outcome Synthesizer
  + context: Multiple agents contribute diverse insights during collaborative problem solving.
  + if: Contributions remain fragmented or unintegrated.
  + however: A coherent output is required to proceed or conclude.
  + then: Activate a synthesis process (role or subroutine) that converges inputs into a cohesive narrative, solution, or plan.
  + because: Divergence without convergence produces noise instead of actionable outcomes.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Collective intelligence research emphasises explicit synthesis stages.
    - Facilitation literature highlights the role of summarisation and convergence tools.

! instantiated-by: Call a Synthesizer
  + context: A team needs to understand or reuse the output of a prior collaborative phase.
  + if: No member has full fluency in the previous material.
  + however: Manual parsing is slow, uneven, or error-prone.
  + then: Introduce a Synthesizer agent or role to digest, integrate, and report back the key takeaways, tensions, and open questions.
  + because: Forward motion requires shared grounding in existing work.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Knowledge-curation roles in research projects prevent reinvention and fragmentation.
    - Systems that re-enter complex state rely on summarisation agents for reinitialisation.

! instantiated-by: Co-Design Partners Agent
  + context: You are developing a collective research program or infrastructural system with multiple overlapping stakeholder value-systems.
  + if: Decisions are happening top-down or bottom-up, but not in synchrony.
  + however: Neither consultation nor output publication alone ensures genuine co-design.
  + then: Introduce a Co-Design Partners Agent that maintains explicit shared purpose, navigates tensions, and keeps alive a dynamic map of mutual commitments.
  + because: Trustworthy systems emerge through reciprocal design, not fiat.
  + next-steps:
    - Log one concrete instance of this pattern in the futon3 ledger.
  + evidence-base:
    - Participatory design stresses embedded, ongoing co-design rather than episodic feedback.
    - Value-sensitive design frameworks emphasise maintaining alignment between plural value systems through dialogic processes.

@title HDM - Simulation Beats Reality

! conclusion:
    Treat FUTON6/HDM as a deliberate simulation space that aims to surpass "real" practice in
    navigability and recombinability. Design entries, scholia, and agent protocols for active
    exploration and transformation rather than static citation.

  + context: You are designing HDM as a simulation layer that outperforms linear archives.
  + IF:
      Historical mathematics lives in messy, locally optimised archives (books, PDFs, folklore)
      and both humans and agents are constrained by linear reading plus fragile memory.

  + HOWEVER:
      Without a simulation layer, exploration remains bound to brittle storage formats and siloed narratives.

  + THEN:
      Treat FUTON6/HDM as a deliberate simulation space that aims to surpass "real" practice in
      navigability and recombinability. Design entries, scholia, and agent protocols for active
      exploration and transformation rather than static citation.
      Host a hyperreal representation: the same concepts, theorems, and proofs laid out as a navigable,
      pattern-indexed, flexiformal graph that is easier to explore, refactor, and extend than the archival
      substrate while preserving provenance.

  + BECAUSE:
      Mathematics already lives partly as a hyperreality in imagination; HDM makes that shared and
      concrete. A carefully designed simulation can support more insight, reuse, and collaboration
      than fragmented historical storage.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[State explicitly in the FUTON6 charter that HDM is a simulation layer.]
    next[For every seed domain, ask how the simulated neighbourhood outperforms just reading the papers.]
    next[Use this pattern as a design sanity check for UI/API decisions in F6.]

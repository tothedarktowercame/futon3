! conclusion: talk4real leaves a durable legacy by coupling open, modular infrastructure with graduates who act as agents of collective intelligence. [🌱/友 ➰/互]
  + context: You are explaining how the programme sustains itself beyond the funding window.
  + IF:
    Long-term impact requires both infrastructure and trained stewards.
  + HOWEVER:
    Single-host programmes often collapse when the grant ends.
  + THEN:
    Build modular assets and graduate cohorts who can replicate the method elsewhere.
  + BECAUSE:
    The programme yields software components, data schemas, and design templates alongside researchers fluent in listening, analysis, and redesign.
    Each doctoral project produces a self-contained yet interoperable prototype, so sustainability never depends on a single host institution.
    The Supplement embodies this ethos as a collaboratively authored artefact that is simultaneously document, dataset, and performance.
    Graduates seed the method elsewhere while the open infrastructure supports new nodes linking universities, civic organisations, and cultural institutions into an evolving ecosystem.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add a concrete legacy pathway showing how a cohort would seed a new node.]

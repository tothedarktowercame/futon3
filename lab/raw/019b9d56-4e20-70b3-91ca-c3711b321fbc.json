Use the stack-coherence patterns (e.g. `stack-blocker-detection`) to spot empty dirs or missing artifacts and record `blocked-by[...]` until the prerequisite is done.\n- Watch for repeated sigil pairs in devmaps. The pattern library (e.g. `pattern-differentiation-alarms`) treats duplicates as alarms: either split\/merge the underlying patterns, add a more specific devmap-coherence flexiarg, or retire stale clauses. After adjustments, rerun the TF\u2013IDF embedding + sigil matrices so the fake embedding stays meaningful.\n- Contribute new stack-coherence patterns whenever the project needs cross-futon checks (e.g. comparing READMEs vs git logs). These global patterns should inspect hotspots\u2014git history, README timestamps, file trees\u2014to classify each devmap item as \u201cdone \/ blocked \/ drifting\u201d and help the informal proof engine keep the whole stack honest.\n\n## MUSN stuff\n\nF2 (MUSN) \u2014 One-Page Build Brief\n\nScope (thin waist): Transport + routing only.

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions.\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: \/home\/joe\/.codex\/skills\/.system\/skill-creator\/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME\/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: \/home\/joe\/.codex\/skills\/.system\/skill-installer\/SKILL.md)\n- Discovery: Available skills are listed in project docs and may also appear in a runtime \"## Skills\" section (name + description + file path). These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing\/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references\/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts\/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets\/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Description as trigger: The YAML `description` in `SKILL.md` is the primary trigger signal; rely on it to decide applicability. If unsure, ask a brief clarification before proceeding.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deeply nested references; prefer one-hop files explicitly linked from `SKILL.md`.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n<\/INSTRUCTIONS>"},{"id":"019b9d56-4e20-70b3-91ca-c3711b321fbc:u002","timestamp":"2026-01-08T11:20:37.686Z","text":"<environment_context>\n  <cwd>\/home\/joe\/code\/futon3<\/cwd>\n  <approval_policy>never<\/approval_policy>\n  <sandbox_mode>workspace-write<\/sandbox_mode>\n  <network_access>restricted<\/network_access>\n  <shell>bash<\/shell>\n<\/environment_context>"},{"id":"019b9d56-4e20-70b3-91ca-c3711b321fbc:u003","timestamp":"2026-01-08T11:20:37.686Z","text":"Review the ants patterns in library\/ants and improve fucodex's operating regime using one of them.

@title IFR — FUTON3 Flexiformal Proofwork (pīti)
@sigils [🎑/心 🗂️/证]
@factor Joy / Rapture (pīti)

! conclusion:
  batch-run `check!` against each devmap obligation, log proof states, emit follow-on obligations, and surface joy metrics (time-to-proof, obligations cleared) for everyone doing workday submissions

  + context: Regularly log proof states and surface joy metrics to demonstrate your effective actions during work submissions.
  + IF:
    FUTON3 keeps the pattern canon, similarity field, and check DSL running so daily work can be certified as empowered action

  + HOWEVER:
    without regular audits, the proof trails drift from the devmaps and joy devolves into aimless play

  + THEN:
    batch-run `check!` against each devmap obligation, log proof states, emit follow-on obligations, and surface joy metrics (time-to-proof, obligations cleared) for everyone doing workday submissions

  + BECAUSE:
    pīti is the pleasure of effective action; FUTON3 must constantly show that pattern checks move real obligations forward

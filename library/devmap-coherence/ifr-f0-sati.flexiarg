! conclusion:
  verify that vitality signals (git activity, recording cadence, tai-chi prompts) flow into FUTON3 telemetry, that epistemic rhythm reviews happen on schedule, and that the mindful ground for wondrous apprehension is observable rather than assumed

  + context: FUTON0 provides the embodied/experiential base through which all other futons perceive. Its signals must be traceable.
  + IF:
    FUTON0 claims to supply dependable vitality indicators and epistemic rhythm without added lifelogging friction

  + HOWEVER:
    vitality signals scatter across cron jobs, notes, and implicit habits; without explicit telemetry hooks, the mindful ground becomes oral history

  + THEN:
    verify that vitality signals (git activity, recording cadence, tai-chi prompts) flow into FUTON3 telemetry, that epistemic rhythm reviews happen on schedule, and that the mindful ground for wondrous apprehension is observable rather than assumed

  + BECAUSE:
    sati is the quality of presence that makes all other factors possible; FUTON0 must prove its signals are actually reaching the stack, not just claimed

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add a vitality telemetry check to the FUTON3 morning review that confirms F0 signals arrived.]
    next[Log any missed rhythm reviews (weekly/monthly) as drift markers for F0 health.]

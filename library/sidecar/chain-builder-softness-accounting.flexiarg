! conclusion: Build short chains and report softness per hop.
  + context: Users need explainable chains, not just candidate lists.
  + IF:
    Queries return flat neighbor lists without justification.
  + HOWEVER:
    You want puzzle-like chain recovery with clear evidence.
  + THEN:
    Build short chains over arrows, bridges, and proposals, and report softness metrics.
  + BECAUSE:
    Softness accounting shows where fuzz enters the chain and enables review.
  + evidence: docs/sidecar-chains.md
  + evidence: src/sidecar/store.clj; test/sidecar/store_test.clj
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: src/sidecar/store.clj (chain-score, step-evidence); test/sidecar/store_test.clj
  + BECAUSE->EVIDENCE: test/sidecar/store_test.clj (chain-softness-scoring)
  + use: docs/sidecar-usage.md; docs/sidecar-demo.md
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Document chain scoring and per-hop evidence output in docs/sidecar-chains.md.

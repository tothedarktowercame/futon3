<INSTRUCTIONS>
## Maintaining devmap + pattern coherence

- Keep each futon devmap in sync with reality: when a clause is finished, cite the evidence (README section, test, tag); when it is blocked, note the dependency. Use the stack-coherence patterns (e.g. `stack-blocker-detection`) to spot empty dirs or missing artifacts and record `blocked-by[...]` until the prerequisite is done.
- Watch for repeated sigil pairs in devmaps. The pattern library (e.g. `pattern-differentiation-alarms`) treats duplicates as alarms: either split/merge the underlying patterns, add a more specific devmap-coherence flexiarg, or retire stale clauses. After adjustments, rerun the TF–IDF embedding + sigil matrices so the fake embedding stays meaningful.
- Contribute new stack-coherence patterns whenever the project needs cross-futon checks (e.g. comparing READMEs vs git logs). These global patterns should inspect hotspots—git history, README timestamps, file trees—to classify each devmap item as “done / blocked / drifting” and help the informal proof engine keep the whole stack honest.

## MUSN stuff

F2 (MUSN) — One-Page Build Brief

Scope (thin waist): Transport + routing only. F1 (graph/memory) and F3 (ants) are external via adapters.

Non-goals: No storage, no UI, no inference, no arbitrary eval.

Interfaces you must call (adapters supplied elsewhere)
;; F1
(put-event!      f1 run-id event)            ;; -> {:eid ...}
(close-session!  f1 sid)                     ;; -> {:sid ...}
(export-scenario! f1 sid)                    ;; -> {:scenario-path ...}

;; F3
(run-scenario!   f3 scenario-path policy)    ;; -> {:job-id ...}
(job-status      f3 job-id)                  ;; -> {:state :metrics?}

Message protocol (v1) — JSON lines over WS; HTTP POST fallback

hello {client,caps[]} → ack {rev,run-id}

event {msg-id,t,actor,verb,object,prov} → ack {eid,run-id}

session-close {sid} → ack {sid,run-id}

export {sid} → ack {scenario-path,run-id}

run {scenario-path|sid,policy} → ack {job-id,run-id}

status {job-id} → {state,metrics?}

bye → ack

Rules:

Idempotent on msg-id.

200 ms cap on status, 5 s on run submission.

Per-client supervision: errors never crash the server; return {ok:false,err,...}.

Every ack echoes run-id.

Handlers to implement
handle-hello(ctx,msg)         ; mint run-id, negotiate rev
handle-event(ctx,msg)         ; validate → F1.put-event!
handle-session-close(ctx,msg) ; → F1.close-session!
handle-export(ctx,msg)        ; → F1.export-scenario!
handle-run(ctx,msg)           ; resolve sid→scenario if needed → F3.run-scenario!
handle-status(ctx,msg)        ; → F3.job-status

Validation (malli/spec)

Schemas for event, session-close, export, run, status. Hard-fail on unknown fields; include detail in error.

Back-pressure

Queue or drop with {ok:false,err:"overload"} when >1k events/min locally.

Acceptance tests

Replaying 100 identical events (same msg-id) yields the same eids.

export {sid} returns a path; F2 does not touch the file.

run → job-id; status eventually done with metrics.

Killing a client doesn’t affect others; server logs a clean drop.

make demo   # hello → events → session-close → export → run → status

### Emacs HUD tests
`scripts/test-elisp.sh` drives the chatgpt-shell HUD tests. Keep them gentle by supplying
`ERT_SELECTOR` (e.g., `ERT_SELECTOR='futon3-prototype-*'`) and, when running everything, consider
`ulimit -v 2097152` to avoid GUI Emacs OOMs.


## Skills
A skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.
### Available skills
- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/joe/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)
- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/joe/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)
### How to use skills
- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.
- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.
- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.
- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):
  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.
  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.
  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.
  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.
- Coordination and sequencing:
  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.
  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.
- Context hygiene:
  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.
  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.
  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.
- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
You are running in exploratory pattern mode. Do not wait for a directive.

OBSERVE
- Read the pattern catalog at resources/sigils/patterns-index.tsv.
- Scan the local codebase for a small, concrete improvement.

SELECT
- Choose one pattern that best fits the current context.
- List 2–4 candidates and state which one you chose.

APPLY
- Make one bounded change guided by the chosen pattern.
- Keep the change small and local.

LOG (PSR/PUR)
- Produce a PSR and PUR in the session trace format.
- Include anchors to concrete session events.

CONTINUE or EXIT
- If you can identify a second bounded change that fits a different pattern,
  repeat OBSERVE → SELECT → APPLY → LOG once more.
- Otherwise, stop and summarize.

Constraints:
- Do not run tests unless explicitly asked.
- Stay within the current repo.
- Prefer edits over new files.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Aligned the MUSN protocol doc with the current router/schema behavior: updated lifecycle and message format bullets to reflect `msg-id` idempotency and the `session-close`/`export`/`run`/`status` flow, plus tightened timeout/validation notes in `docs/protocol.md`.

Candidates considered: `stack-coherence/staleness-scan`, `stack-coherence/readme-devmap-sync`, `code-coherence/dead-code-hygiene`, `devmap-coherence/next-steps-to-done` → chosen `stack-coherence/staleness-scan`.

## PSR (Pattern Selection Record)
- **Cycle**: 1
- **Pattern chosen**: `stack-coherence/staleness-scan`
- **Candidates considered**: `stack-coherence/staleness-scan`, `stack-coherence/readme-devmap-sync`, `code-coherence/dead-code-hygiene`, `devmap-coherence/next-steps-to-done`
- **Rationale**: `docs/protocol.md` had drift against the live MUSN message shapes and idempotency rules; small doc sync reduces mismatched expectations.
- **Confidence**: medium
- **Anchors**: `resources/sigils/patterns-index.tsv` (pattern scan), `rg -n "TODO|FIXME|XXX" src/f2 src/futon3 docs` (scan), `docs/protocol.md` (edit target)

## PUR (Pattern Use Record)
- **Pattern**: `stack-coherence/staleness-scan`
- **Actions taken**: Updated MUSN protocol doc to reflect `msg-id` idempotency and current message types/timeouts in `docs/protocol.md`.
- **Outcome**: success
- **Prediction error**: low
- **Notes**: Keeps doc aligned with router/schema reality.
- **Anchors**: `docs/protocol.md`

No second bounded change identified; stopping here.

## Session Summary
- **Cycles completed**: 1
- **Patterns applied**: `stack-coherence/staleness-scan`
- **Changes made**: `docs/protocol.md` (message formats/lifecycle/idempotency/validation sync)
- **Patterns that didn't fit**: none
- **Proposed patterns**: none

No tests run (per instruction). If you want a second cycle with a different pattern family, say the word.

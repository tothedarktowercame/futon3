! conclusion: Escalate when expected error cost exceeds coordination cost.
  + context: An agent must choose between acting locally and involving others.
  + IF:
    A decision could carry material risk or irreversible impact.
  + HOWEVER:
    Coordination costs discourage escalation, while risk-blind escalation wastes time on low-stakes work.
  + THEN:
    Estimate risk cost (impact x likelihood) and compare it to coordination cost. Escalate when risk cost exceeds a defined threshold, and log the comparison basis.
  + BECAUSE:
    This preserves speed on low-stakes actions while protecting high-stakes decisions.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Define risk categories and default impact scales for your domain.
    - Calibrate escalation thresholds with real incidents.
    - Log escalation decisions alongside their risk and cost estimates.

! conclusion:
  verify that Portal retrieves patterns reliably, Sidecar logs complete PSR/PUR chains, and Compass scores are explainable; confirm that futon3a serves as operational hub by checking cross-futon coordination artifacts

  + context: FUTON3A is the pattern guidance and audit logging layer — Portal, Sidecar, Compass. It aims to become the operational hub for the stack.
  + IF:
    FUTON3A provides pattern retrieval, audit trails, and alignment scoring that other futons depend on for coordination

  + HOWEVER:
    without regular validation, portal queries may return stale patterns, sidecar chains may have gaps, and compass scores may become decorative rather than actionable

  + THEN:
    verify that Portal retrieves patterns reliably, Sidecar logs complete PSR/PUR chains, and Compass scores are explainable; confirm that futon3a serves as operational hub by checking cross-futon coordination artifacts

  + BECAUSE:
    pīti-audit extends pīti (joy of effective action) to the audit layer itself — futon3a must prove it can coordinate the stack, not just log events

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Run portal latency + cache hit checks weekly; flag degradation.]
    next[Validate PSR/PUR chain completeness in morning review; emit obligations for gaps.]
    next[Test compass scoring on known-good/known-bad cases quarterly to prevent drift.]
    next[Track hub coordination metrics: how many cross-futon missions ran successfully via futon3a queue.]

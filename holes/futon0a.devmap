! instantiated-by: Prototype 0 — Mindfulness Engine & Being-towards-Death [🧘/己 ⏰/日]
  + context: FUTON0 is not just a clock; it is the layer that notices the gap between intention and action and uses that gap as a mindfulness signal.
  + if: You want the entire FUTON stack to be grounded in real, embodied present-moment awareness rather than abstract planning.
  + however: The clock and timestamps can be treated as neutral infrastructure, leaving the existential content (fatigue vs boredom, avoidance vs choice, little “deaths” of the day) unexamined.
  + then: Define FUTON0 explicitly as the Being-towards-death engine: every timestamped action or non-action is an opportunity to ask “What is it now?” and to log a minimal state (intention, feel-tone, fruit/orb) that reflects this.
  + because: Without FUTON0 as an honest witness, the rest of the stack becomes sophisticated sleepwalking; with it, every moment can feed practice and design.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Vital Signs & Daily Energetic Texture [🏃/卫 😴/已]
  + context: Tai chi, sleep, exercise, creative practice, and basic nutrition form the physiological substrate for all higher work.
  + if: You want early warnings when vitality drifts and a life that is actually livable, not just well-planned.
  + however: Indicators like “I’m too tired to go to tai chi” or “I didn’t record today” can mask boredom, fog, or misaligned intention; logs can remain purely quantitative.
  + then: Track a small set of vital signs via FUTON0 (sleep quality, movement, tai chi attendance, creative time) and annotate them with fruits (e.g., 🍒 doable, 🍓 doable-but-ambitious, 👻 blocker) and relevant paramitās (e.g., Determination, Equanimity) to capture both what happened and how it was approached.
  + because: Vital signs plus qualitative labels make it possible to distinguish genuine depletion from avoidant drift and keep the rest of the stack honest about the body it runs on.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Intention–Action Delta & Fatigue vs Boredom [🍌/己 🧠/己]
  + context: Many key tensions (tai chi decision, morning compositions, Go study) live in the misreading of internal state.
  + if: You want FUTON0 to reveal whether you are truly exhausted, merely bored, or subtly avoiding.
  + however: Without a simple protocol, states get labelled lazily (“too tired”) and intentions become vague aspirational noise.
  + then: Introduce a lightweight FUTON0 check whenever an intention is skipped: ask “If something genuinely interesting appeared, would I perk up?” and log the answer with a fruit (🍌 indicator, 👻 blocker, 🍐 obligation) plus a paramitā orb (e.g., Equanimity/Analysis when discernment is being trained).
  + because: Treating the intention–action delta as a first-class signal turns each micro-failure into data for self-knowledge instead of a diffuse sense of guilt.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 3 — Fruits & Paramitās as FUTON0 Typing System [🍒/己 🟣/己]
  + context: You now have a stable lexicon of fruits (doable, stretch, obligation, indicator, etc.) and paramitās (qualities of practice), plus Sway keybindings to insert them anywhere.
  + if: You want FUTON0 to be the place where these glyphs acquire operational meaning, not just aesthetic flair.
  + however: Without a clear role, fruits/orbs risk becoming decoration rather than typed metadata that upstream futons can use.
  + then: Treat fruits as karma-structure types (what kind of event/commitment this is) and paramitās as practice-quality types (how you are showing up); require that FUTON0 entries (especially for key decisions and skipped intentions) carry at least one fruit and one orb.
  + because: This makes FUTON0 the source of typed behavioural data that F1–F7 can read: not just “what happened,” but “what kind of karma and what quality of mind were present.”

! instantiated-by: Prototype 4 — Epistemic Rhythm & Salients (Weekly Programme) [📅/上 ⚖️/义]
  + context: Weekly reviews, AOB/Ambitions meetings, and Org as source of truth form the rhythmic backbone for sense-making.
  + if: You want a stable programme mindset where salients across spheres remain visible and WIP stays within humane limits.
  + however: Without a normalised protocol, weekly rhythm slips, data fragments, and focus quietly exceeds capacity.
  + then: Use FUTON0 to mark weekly review sessions and salients with fruits (e.g., 🥨 salients, 🍐 obligations, 🚀 core ambitions) and to log WIP-count decisions; treat “too many 🍓/🚀 in flight” as a signal to adjust commitments.
  + because: Rhythm tracked through fruits and paramitās lets later futons rely on an epistemically balanced programme rather than a chaotic one.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Core Obligations & Economic Reality [🍐/己 💰/女]
  + context: Job performance, role transition by Aug 2026, debt reduction, and minimum health baselines are non-negotiable constraints.
  + if: You want the FUTON stack to exist inside actual economic and temporal limits rather than fantasy.
  + however: Obligations easily fade into background anxiety when attention locks onto higher-level prototypes or speculative futures.
  + then: Log explicit 🍐 obligation entries in FUTON0 for core duties (job tasks, applications, financial moves, health commitments), and periodically review their paramitā profiles (e.g., do obligations mainly exercise Determination, Generosity, or Equanimity?).
  + because: Seeing obligations as concrete karmic fruits with specific practice qualities keeps them grounded and prevents the “stack” from drifting off the substrate that pays for it.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 6 — Creative Practice as Daily Dojo [🎙️/子 🎭/己]
  + context: You intend to do improvisatory creative-writing-music-backed storytelling each morning, but rarely do.
  + if: You want this practice to become a central dojo where many patterns (Mojo, Paramitā, Hyperreal, band work) cross-pollinate.
  + however: The gap between stated intention and actual practice is currently large and under-instrumented.
  + then: Treat each creative session (or skipped session) as a FUTON0 event: log whether it happened, tag with fruits (🍒/🍓/👻), and mark the dominant paramitā (e.g., Determination when you show up despite friction, Equanimity when you let yourself rest wisely).
  + because: Making creative practice legible at FUTON0 turns it into a measurable training ground for the qualities you want the whole civilisation layer (F7) to exhibit.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 7 — FUTON0 → Other Futons Mapping (Vertical Wiring) [🕸️/井 🔗/入]
  + context: F1–F7 rely on memory, pattern, agents, argumentarium, and civic design, all of which benefit from knowing how events felt and what they “were” karmically.
  + if: You want fruits and paramitās to function as a shared internal language across the stack, not just in journaling.
  + however: There is no explicit mapping from FUTON0’s glyph-rich entries into F1 memory schemas, F5 patterns, or F6 argument annotations.
  + then: Define a minimal vertical mapping: FUTON0 entries with fruits/paramitās become tagged episodes in F1; aggregated fruit patterns inform F5 pattern tuning (e.g., recurring 👻+🍐 combos indicate a stuck pattern); selected FUTON0 episodes feed F6 arguments as concrete cases; and F7 uses the long-run distribution of fruits/orbs as a civic “mood” indicator.
  + because: This turns FUTON0 into the ground-truth sensorium of the stack—other futons don’t guess about lived experience, they read it.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 8 — Stack Coverage Check & Devmap Completeness [📚/门 🧾/口]
  + context: FUTON0 already took responsibility for ensuring every FUTON prototype has devmap coverage.
  + if: You want the futons’ obligations, salients, and ambitions to be monitorable in one place.
  + however: Missing or stale devmaps currently result in silent blind spots.
  + then: Use FUTON0 to track devmap health as a recurring 🍌 indicator (e.g., monthly “devmap audit” entry with 🥨 salients for missing/stale maps); treat unresolved devmap gaps as 🍐 obligations tagged with appropriate paramitās (e.g., Determination for writing, Equanimity for not overloading).
  + because: A complete and updated devmap library is the only way future agents (and future-you) can reason about the stack reliably.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 9 — Yearly Being-towards-Death Review [🔄/入 💀/己]
  + context: FUTON0’s deepest mandate is existential: to track how a finite life is actually being spent.
  + if: You want regular contact with the question “If this were my last year, would I still do this?” to inform planning.
  + however: Without a ritualised review, this question appears sporadically and emotionally rather than structurally.
  + then: Once per year, run a FUTON0-based review using fruits (what kinds of karma dominated?), paramitās (which qualities matured?), and key futon-linked episodes (F1–F7) to assess alignment with your long arc; log the results as a dedicated devmap-aware entry.
  + because: Periodically re-seeing your life through the lens of finite time is what keeps the whole stack oriented around what actually matters.

! conclusion: Involving other agents or humans has overhead; factor it into decisions.
  + context: An agent can work alone or involve others (other agents, human supervisors, external services).
  + IF:
    The agent wants to leverage external capabilities or get authoritative answers.
  + HOWEVER:
    Coordination is not free: it takes time, consumes attention, introduces latency, and may require context transfer. Treating it as free leads to over-reliance or spamming.
  + THEN:
    Model coordination as an action with explicit cost (latency, tokens, human attention units). Include this cost in decision-making: sometimes working with partial local knowledge is better than waiting for external input, unless the risk of error is higher than the coordination cost.
  + BECAUSE:
    Cost-aware coordination prevents both under-use (never asking for help when stuck) and over-use (constant interruption). It respects the resources of collaborators.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Inventory coordination actions your agent can take (ask human, call service, delegate to agent).
    - Assign cost estimates to each and include them in action selection.
    - Track actual coordination costs and update estimates based on experience.

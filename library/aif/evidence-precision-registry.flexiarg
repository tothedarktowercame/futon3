! conclusion: Make evidence weighting explicit by logging a precision registry per observation channel.
  + context: The agent must treat some inputs as more reliable than others (tests vs narrative claims, trace anchors vs inferred intent).
  + IF:
    You want the agent to discount low-trust evidence without discarding it, and to become stricter when outcomes are volatile.
  + HOWEVER:
    Without an explicit precision layer, evidence weighting becomes implicit prompt rhetoric and cannot be audited.
  + THEN:
    Represent (Pi_o) as a per-channel precision registry keyed to observation features (and/or evidence sources), and apply it wherever prediction error, scoring, or gating occurs.
  + BECAUSE:
    Making precision explicit turns trust into a tunable control surface rather than an undocumented bias.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Start with a small set of channels (for example: :tests, :typecheck, :static-analysis, :tool-output, :user-constraints, :model-inference).
    - Record precision adjustments as first-class events so audits can reconstruct why confidence shifted.

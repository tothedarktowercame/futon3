@title Prototype Alignment — Context & Bridge Check
@sigils [⚡️/工 🙇/刊]
@references [p4ng/bridge-before-portal p4ng/pattern-activation]

! conclusion:
  inspect the prototype text for (a) explicit upstream reference, (b) defined bridge artifact (API, trail, ritual), and (c) declared downstream consumer; flag gaps and emit a follow-up obligation when any element is missing

  + context: Inspect prototypes for clear upstream references and defined bridges to ensure handoffs are testable.
  + IF:
    a FUTON devmap prototype claims to hand work from one layer to the next (e.g., FUTON2 → FUTON3)

  + HOWEVER:
    context clauses often omit the concrete bridge (export, adapter, shared ritual) that makes the handoff testable

  + THEN:
    inspect the prototype text for (a) explicit upstream reference, (b) defined bridge artifact (API, trail, ritual), and (c) declared downstream consumer; flag gaps and emit a follow-up obligation when any element is missing

  + BECAUSE:
    pattern-capable agents need bridges-before-portals (per p4ng) and explicit pattern activation surfaces to keep prototypes more than aspirational

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add a bridge checklist to each prototype and require a named downstream consumer.]
    next[Log any missing bridge elements as explicit follow-up obligations.]

! conclusion: Treat symbolic work as legitimate infrastructure while separating it from domains needing different exposure strategies.
  + context: You sustain meaningful symbolic or creative work without reliable developmental colleagues, while experiencing pressure from futures that could exist.
  + IF:
    You continue solitary symbolic work that feels intrinsically right and notice it supports clarity and orientation toward the future.
  + HOWEVER:
    If that work is treated as indulgent or merely private, you may misinterpret the absence of colleagues or relational transitions as personal failure or immaturity.
  + THEN:
    Treat the symbolic work as legitimate infrastructural labor: a stable camp that preserves agency and anticipatory capacity, while deliberately separating it from domains that require different exposure strategies.
  + BECAUSE:
    Symbolic futures exert real pressure in the present without being causal; equanimity depends on distinguishing which systems require planning versus openness.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Observe where longing arises from ecological mismatch rather than lack.
    - Track whether pressure is misrouted between domains (for example, solving collegial absence through romance).

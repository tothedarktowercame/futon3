! conclusion:
  correlate commit messages/PRs with devmap IDs; for each match, update the clause status + evidence ledger; if a clause stays marked “planned” despite recent commits, flag it as `drift` and prompt someone to reconcile

  + context: You need to ensure that actual development work reflected in commits and PRs stays aligned with work plans as both code and plans evolve.
  
  + IF:
    git commits reference a prototype or futon clause (“Prototype 4 done”, “stack blocker cleared”) while the devmap still lists it as planned/blocked

  + HOWEVER:
    that disconnect makes the roadmap lie about where energy went

  + THEN:
    correlate commit messages/PRs with devmap IDs; for each match, update the clause status + evidence ledger; if a clause stays marked “planned” despite recent commits, flag it as `drift` and prompt someone to reconcile

  + BECAUSE:
    viriya is kinetic practice—commits and devmaps must reflect the same movement or we lose trust in both

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add a nightly scan that correlates commits/PRs with devmap IDs and updates evidence.]
    next[Flag any clause still marked planned after matching commits for reconciliation.]

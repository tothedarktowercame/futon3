+ CONTEXT:
    Missions progress through defined states. Without a formal lifecycle,
    missions drift indefinitely or are abandoned without evidence. The
    proof-path pattern governs individual changes; this pattern governs
    the mission as a whole.

+ IF:
    You are defining, tracking, or transitioning a mission.

+ HOWEVER:
    Missions may be blocked by dependencies, split into sub-missions,
    or merged when scope overlaps. The lifecycle must accommodate these.

+ THEN:
    Apply the mission state machine:

    ```
    :greenfield → :scoped → :active → :blocked → :review → :done
                     ↑          ↓         ↓
                     └──────────┴─────────┘ (can regress)
    ```

    State definitions:
    - :greenfield - Idea captured, no work plan
    - :scoped - Success criteria, boundaries, dependencies defined
    - :active - Work in progress, owner assigned
    - :blocked - Waiting on dependency (cite blocker)
    - :review - Work complete, awaiting verification
    - :done - Success criteria met, evidence recorded

    Transition requirements:
    - greenfield → scoped: Mission doc has success criteria + scope
    - scoped → active: Owner assigned, dependencies clear
    - active → blocked: Blocker cited with link to blocking mission
    - active → review: All success criteria addressed
    - review → done: Evidence verified by reviewer
    - Any → :abandoned: Explicit decision with rationale

+ BECAUSE:
    - Explicit states prevent invisible drift
    - Transition requirements create evidence trail
    - Blocked states surface dependency graphs
    - Review gates ensure verification before closure

+ GOVERNANCE:
    Mission state transitions should be recorded:
    - In mission doc header (Status field)
    - Optionally in MUSN activity stream
    - With timestamp and agent attribution

+ NEXT-STEPS:
    - Check current mission state
    - Verify transition requirements are met
    - Update mission doc with new state
    - If blocked, link to blocker mission

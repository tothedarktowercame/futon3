! conclusion:
  Define the VSAT proof-of-concept as testing whether a minimal story-linking
  capability helps groups understand their shared situation better.

  + context: You are defining proof-of-concept to be a single testable claim (in this case, whether minimal story linking helps groups gain shared insight).
  + IF:
    Individual stories already shine; the missing capability is “story links →
    group insight”.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without a crisp test concept, funding can drift into general improvements.

  + THEN:
    State that the POC will test whether a basic link/propose/confirm/view loop
    yields new insight for cohorts.

  + BECAUSE:
    Narrow scope keeps effort tied to a partner-relevant question.

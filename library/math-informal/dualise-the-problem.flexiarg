! conclusion:
  Reverse the arrows, take complements, or transpose — the dual problem may be easier.

  + context: You have a problem stated in terms of maps, sets, or conditions, and direct approaches are stuck.
  + IF:
      The problem has a natural duality: a categorical opposite, a vector space dual, a Boolean
      complement, a Fourier transform, a Lagrangian dual, or simply the contrapositive of a
      logical statement.

  + HOWEVER:
      Not every problem dualises cleanly. Some dualities lose structure (the double dual may not
      be isomorphic to the original). You must verify that the dual problem actually helps.

  + THEN:
      Reformulate the problem in the dual setting. Solve it there if easier. Translate the
      solution back. For logical statements, try the contrapositive before attempting direct proof.

  + BECAUSE:
      Duality is pervasive: Pontryagin duality, Stone duality, linear programming duality,
      Poincare duality, Serre duality. A problem that is opaque in one setting can become
      transparent in its dual.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify which duality applies to your setting.]
    next[Reformulate the problem in the dual language.]
    next[Solve and translate back.]

! conclusion:
  When a sequence does not converge, extract a convergent subsequence and argue from there.

  + context: You need convergence or a limit, but the full sequence or net may not cooperate.
  + IF:
      You are working in a compact space (or a setting with a compactness hypothesis), and the
      sequence or net is bounded but not necessarily convergent.

  + HOWEVER:
      The subsequence may converge to something unwanted. You must verify that the limit has
      the properties you need, and that the argument does not depend on the specific subsequence
      chosen.

  + THEN:
      Invoke compactness (Bolzano-Weierstrass, Alaoglu, Tychonoff, sequential compactness) to
      extract a convergent subsequence. Pass to it. Argue that the limit has the desired property.
      If necessary, show the limit is unique so the full sequence converges.

  + BECAUSE:
      Compactness arguments are the engine of analysis. "Pass to a subsequence" converts a
      possibly wild sequence into a tame one at the cost of losing control over indices — a
      trade-off that is almost always worth making.

    next[Extract the convergent subsequence and identify the limit.]
    next[Check that the limit has the properties you need.]

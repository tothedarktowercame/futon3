! conclusion: Seeing the Surrounding Conditions
+if: A doctoral project sits inside wider institutional systems—data governance, shared infrastructure, ethics boards, administrative rhythms—but the researcher only sees the immediate task.
+however: Responsible decisions about methods, data, and collaboration require awareness of upstream dependencies and downstream effects.
+then: Guide the researcher through mapping dependencies, meeting governance partners, and reflecting on how their actions touch technical, administrative, and academic stakeholders so the surrounding system stays in view.
+because: Systems-level awareness improves decision quality, anticipates bottlenecks, and prepares researchers for future roles with broader responsibility by teaching how individual work affects the collective environment.

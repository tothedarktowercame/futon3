! conclusion:
  mirror the stack-coherence evidence-ledger practice inside the library: require each pattern entry to list concrete namespaces/docs/tests, add CI checks that fail when fields are blank, and update the ledger whenever new proofs land; store the citations next to the pattern IDs so the `check!` DSL can surface them

  + context: You are ensuring every pattern claim has auditable, concrete evidence.
  + IF:
    the pattern store (`resources/pattern_store.edn`) declares which devmap clauses are blocked, in-progress, or done

  + HOWEVER:
    those records drift unless every clause cites verifiable evidence (README sections, namespaces, and tests) that anyone can inspect

  + THEN:
    mirror the stack-coherence evidence-ledger practice inside the library: require each pattern entry to list concrete namespaces/docs/tests, add CI checks that fail when fields are blank, and update the ledger whenever new proofs land; store the citations next to the pattern IDs so the `check!` DSL can surface them

  + BECAUSE:
    a canon without an evidence ledger collapses into lore—dhammavicaya demands that every “ready” claim is backed by published artifacts

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Backfill missing evidence citations for the highest-priority patterns.]

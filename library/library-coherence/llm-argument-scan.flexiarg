! conclusion: Use an LLM to assemble a coherent argument from pattern summaries when library ordering is unclear.
  + context: You are reviewing a library where patterns should scaffold a coherent argument but the ordering is implicit or missing.
  + IF:
    The library’s argument exists in fragments across pattern summaries (!conclusion or devmap instantiated-by lines).
  + HOWEVER:
    Readers may not infer the argument without an explicit narrative flow.
  + THEN:
    Use an LLM to scan the summary fields, cluster related claims, order them into a draft argument, and read it back for coherence and gaps.
  + BECAUSE:
    LLMs are strong at structuring and critiquing text, which helps surface missing links and redundancies.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - evidence: a generated argument draft that cites the contributing pattern summaries.
    - evidence: a reviewer note listing at least one missing link or redundancy found by the LLM pass.
    - evidence-shape: {:library :string, :summaries [:string], :draft-argument :string, :gaps [:string], :redundancies [:string]}

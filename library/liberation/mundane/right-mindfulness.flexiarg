! conclusion: Establish mindfulness on the four foundations — body, feelings, mind, and phenomena — with clear comprehension, free from craving and aversion toward the world.
  + context: This operates in the moment-to-moment awareness of experience. Mindfulness is the capacity to be present with what is happening without being swept away by it.
  + IF:
    Experience flows constantly but attention is usually captured by interpretation, reaction, or distraction. Without mindfulness, patterns run automatically.
  + HOWEVER:
    "Practicing mindfulness" can become another thing to do, another identity to construct, another way to feel good about oneself. The problem is not awareness but awareness that has become self-conscious project.
  + THEN:
    Practice the four foundations: (1) mindfulness of body (breathing, postures, activities, parts, elements, decay), (2) mindfulness of feelings (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral), (3) mindfulness of mind (contracted/expanded, concentrated/scattered, liberated/not), (4) mindfulness of phenomena (hindrances, aggregates, sense bases, awakening factors, truths).
  + BECAUSE:
    Mundane right mindfulness creates conditions for seeing clearly — without awareness of what's happening, wisdom has no material to work with. But one can practice mindfulness while still attached to "being mindful," to the calm that comes from attention, to progress in practice. This is better than wrong mindfulness but not yet liberation.
  + MUNDANE-CONTENT:
    - Body: sustained attention to bodily experience as it is
    - Feelings: recognizing the tone of experience (pleasant/unpleasant/neutral)
    - Mind: knowing the current state of the mind
    - Phenomena: recognizing patterns arising and passing
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-WRONG-MINDFULNESS:
    Wrong mindfulness: attention captured by craving, directed toward harmful ends
    Mundane right mindfulness: four foundations — AND awareness that the practice itself can be grasped
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Establish regular practice of the foundations, beginning with body.
    - Notice when mindfulness becomes "trying to be mindful."
    - Let attention rest in experience without commentary.
  + RIPENS-IN:
    Reduced reactivity, clearer seeing, more choice in response — but still within the world of meditators and meditation, still attached to states.

    - liberation/mundane/right-effort (effort supports mindfulness)

! conclusion:
  When a proof is ugly or a pattern recurs, seek a higher-level framework where it becomes natural.

  + context: You have a proof that works but feels ad hoc, or you see the same argument repeated in several settings.
  + IF:
      The proof involves case splits, coordinate choices, or auxiliary constructions that seem to
      serve no conceptual purpose, or the same lemma keeps reappearing in different guises across
      different domains.

  + HOWEVER:
      Premature abstraction obscures rather than clarifies: abstracting before you have enough
      examples risks building a framework that fits nothing well. The right abstraction is found,
      not prescribed.

  + THEN:
      Identify the minimal structural assumptions your argument actually uses. Reformulate in terms
      of those assumptions alone. If a known framework (group, category, topological space, measure
      space) fits, use it; if not, you may have discovered a new one.

  + BECAUSE:
      The right abstraction turns a difficult proof into a trivial one. Much of 20th-century
      mathematics consisted of finding the right level of generality (e.g., Grothendieck's schemes,
      Eilenberg-Mac Lane's categories).

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[List the properties your proof actually uses.]
    next[Search for existing frameworks that axiomatise those properties.]
    next[Reformulate and check whether the proof simplifies.]

! conclusion: At close range, use your center; the elbow strike is short, direct, and governed by the waist.
  + context: An agent is in close quarters with a problem—no room for long-range moves, redirects, or elaborate maneuvers.
  + IF:
    The situation is immediate and proximate; there's no space for setup or wind-up.
  + HOWEVER:
    Close range without center engagement becomes flailing. The elbow's power doesn't come from the arm—it comes from the feet through the waist. Short-range without structure is just thrashing.
  + THEN:
    When you're too close for extended moves, engage from your center. Zhǒu is short-range energy that travels from feet through waist to elbow—a direct line from ground through core to contact point. It can strike, block, or control. Multiple directions are possible, but all originate from center.
  + BECAUSE:
    Some patterns apply at close range—when you're already in the middle of execution, when there's no time to step back and reassess. The center (core values, grounded scope) still governs even rapid close-range action.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - When in close quarters, don't reach—engage from center.
    - Keep the waist (core judgment) governing rapid actions.
    - Short-range moves still need rooting.
  + RELATED-PATTERNS:
    - agent/sense-deliberate-act (rapid but centered cycles)
    - agent/budget-bounds-exploration (bounded action radius)

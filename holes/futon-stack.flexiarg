! conclusion:
  The futon stack is infrastructure for knowledge work that persists, compounds,
  and transfers—turning ephemeral problem-solving into durable, reusable artefacts.

  + context: Most knowledge work disappears. You solve a problem, write some code,
    have an insight—and then it's gone, locked in your head or scattered across
    emails and notebooks.

  + IF:
    you want knowledge work to persist and compound rather than evaporate

  + HOWEVER:
    current tools treat each session as ephemeral; insights are not captured,
    patterns are not named, and reasoning is not checkable

  + THEN:
    build layered infrastructure where everything is addressable, agents have
    principled perception-action loops, reasoning is checkable, and patterns
    transfer across domains

  + BECAUSE:
    compounding requires persistence, and transfer requires abstraction—the
    stack provides both


! conclusion:
  FUTON1 provides graph memory where everything—text fragments, relationships,
  annotations—lives as addressable nodes that can be queried and linked.

  + IF: you need a foundation for persistent knowledge
  + HOWEVER: scattered files and databases do not support linking and querying
  + THEN: store everything as graph nodes with typed edges
  + BECAUSE: addressable nodes are the prerequisite for all higher layers


! conclusion:
  FUTON2 provides an active inference engine that gives agents a principled way
  to observe their environment, perceive what matters, and act—this same engine
  powers both the reasoning agents in futon3 and the cellular automata
  experiments in futon5.

  + IF: agents need to act in changing environments
  + HOWEVER: ad-hoc agent loops lack principled grounding
  + THEN: implement observe-perceive-affect-policy-act loops with free energy minimization
  + BECAUSE: active inference provides a unified framework for perception and action


! conclusion:
  FUTON3 handles the messy reality of human reasoning: arguments that are not
  formal proofs but still need to be checked, patterns that recur across problems,
  and the gap between how people actually think and what machines can verify.

  + IF: real reasoning is informal but still needs validation
  + HOWEVER: formal proof systems reject most human arguments
  + THEN: build flexiformal pattern checking that validates structure without requiring full formalization
  + BECAUSE: checked informal arguments are more valuable than unchecked ones


! conclusion:
  FUTON4 provides the editing environment where documents, patterns, and
  annotations share a common workspace—Arxana links fragments and scholia so you
  can see how ideas connect and evolve.

  + IF: knowledge workers need to edit and annotate linked content
  + HOWEVER: traditional editors treat documents as isolated files
  + THEN: build a hypertext editor where fragments, links, and scholia coexist
  + BECAUSE: connected editing reveals structure that flat files hide


! conclusion:
  FUTON5 collects design patterns for improvisation—not fixed procedures but
  flexible moves that transfer across domains. Wiring diagrams give these patterns
  a category-theoretic interpretation, and a transfer milestone proves that
  patterns developed in one domain (cellular automata) work in another (ant
  simulations).

  + IF: you want reusable patterns for improvisation
  + HOWEVER: informal patterns lack compositional semantics
  + THEN: represent patterns as wiring diagrams with CT interpretation; prove transfer across domains
  + BECAUSE: compositional patterns can be developed once and applied many times


! conclusion:
  FUTON6 builds a mathematics dictionary where informal reasoning patterns sit
  alongside formal proofs, making mathematical knowledge navigable rather than
  locked in textbooks.

  + IF: mathematical knowledge should be navigable and reusable
  + HOWEVER: textbooks are linear and proofs are opaque
  + THEN: build a dictionary with informal arguments, cross-domain patterns, and domain-specific constructs
  + BECAUSE: named patterns at multiple levels make mathematics teachable and transferable


! conclusion:
  FUTON7 applies these ideas to economic life. Hyperreal Enterprises operates as
  a seed institution testing transparent governance. Gravpad does to the web what
  street art does to cities—adding commentary and accountability information
  without requiring permission from those being made transparent. Scenario
  simulations let you prototype civic and economic structures before committing
  to them.

  + IF: economic and civic structures need transparency
  + HOWEVER: current systems obscure costs, relationships, and externalities
  + THEN: build transparency infrastructure that does not require permission from those being made transparent
  + BECAUSE: accountability should not depend on voluntary disclosure


! conclusion:
  The layers connect through shared infrastructure: graph memory stores everything,
  active inference provides the perception-action loop, pattern checking validates
  reasoning, and wiring diagrams transfer between domains.

  + context: Cross-futon bridges make the stack cohere.

  + BRIDGES:
    f1 ──graph memory──→ f4 (Arxana stores documents as graph nodes)
    f2 ──AIF engine──→ f3 (fulab agents use observe-perceive-act loop)
    f2 ──AIF engine──→ f5 (MetaCA uses same infrastructure)
    f3 ──checked arguments──→ f6 (informal reasoning imports to dictionary)
    f5 ──wiring diagrams──→ f2 (transfer from MetaCA to ant simulation)
    f6 ──mathematical models──→ f7 (scenario simulations use growth models)

  + IF: layers must interoperate
  + HOWEVER: isolated layers become silos
  + THEN: define explicit bridges with shared infrastructure
  + BECAUSE: coherence requires connection

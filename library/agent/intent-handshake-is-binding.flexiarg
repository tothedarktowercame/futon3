! conclusion: A run should not start until the agent has restated and bound the intent and scope.
  + context: An agent is about to begin a session or new turn.
  + IF:
    The system needs a reliable record of what the agent believes it is doing.
  + HOWEVER:
    If intent only lives in the prompt or UI, it drifts: agents reinterpret mid-run without explicit renegotiation.
  + THEN:
    Require a handshake that echoes intent, scope, constraints, and success criteria, and record an acknowledgment. Changes to intent or scope require an explicit renegotiation event before further actions.
  + BECAUSE:
    Binding intent makes the run auditable and prevents silent goal drift.
    + evidence: Fulab HUD prompts require an intent restatement (`src/futon3/fulab/hud.clj`), and `fuclaude --intent` passes intent into the HUD.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Add an intent-handshake event to the session start protocol.
    - Block tool actions until the handshake is logged.
    - Record intent changes as first-class events with rationale.
    - Emit an explicit intent-handshake event in lab sessions and enforce it before tool calls.

! conclusion: A repository transition is best led using a lightweight, iterative [👉/义 🌹/门]
              identity→projection→capability process.
  + because: Repository behaviour emerges from stakeholders acting through the
             university’s guiding principles.
    + instantiated-by: (Slide 1) We ARE {Depositors, Downloaders, Governors,
                       Assessors, Archivists, Students} AND we BELIEVE in
                       {Inclusivity, Confidence, Enterprising Creativity,
                       Connectedness, Generosity of Spirit}.
    + therefore: Any change effort must begin by mapping identity-based
                 expectations before focusing on systems.

  + because: Identity alone does not determine behaviour; it is always projected
             into PCE-defined capability dimensions.
    + instantiated-by: (Slide 2) PCE = Strategy, Responsibility, Connectivity,
                       Inclusivity, Development — the operational “output space.”
    + therefore: Misalignment between identity and capability appears as
                 productive tensions rather than failures.

  + because: These tensions can be used as design signals with a simple,
             repeatable leadership pattern.
    + instantiated-by: (Slide 3) Transformation Cycle:
        - Surface tensions & signals
        - Elicit minimum viable requirements
        - Publish transparent workflows
        - Listen lightly (micro-feedback)
        - Iterate in a safe operating zone
    + illustrates: Leadership does not require heavy machinery; only a process
                   for turning tensions into requirements.
    + therefore: A Grade 11 Lead with a small team can run this process.

  + underpinned-by: This model aligns with OBU identity AND with PCE capability
                    expectations.
    + specifies: OBU values → motivation, culture, purpose
    + specifies: PCE criteria → constraints, governance, performance
    + specifies: Pattern-based tension analysis → method for bridging the two

  + therefore: The R&I Lead role is fundamentally one of shaping the projection
               from identity into capability through iterative, transparent
               pattern-based responsiveness.

! conclusion: Current institutional reality distorts several of the Role × Value invariants. [⚠️/尸 🔍/己]

  + because: Plural visibility is only partially realised.
    + illustrates: Some stakeholder groups (e.g., PGRs, interdisciplinary researchers)
                   have lower visibility due to metadata rigidity or workflow gaps.
    + therefore: Inclusivity-in-practice does not fully match Inclusivity-in-principle.

  + because: Trust surfaces are inconsistently expressed.
    + illustrates: Rights metadata varies in completeness; embargo management can be 
                   opaque; legacy records reduce clarity.
    + therefore: Confidence and Responsibility are unevenly projected into the system.

  + because: Interoperability is constrained by system architecture.
    + illustrates: Limited metadata flexibility; siloed reuse signals; 
                   external deposits (GitHub, Zenodo, OSF) not coherently linked.
    + therefore: Connectedness and Creativity are restricted despite institutional values.

  + because: Contribution friction remains high for many depositors.
    + illustrates: Manual data entry; unclear guidance; inconsistent support; 
                   dependency on individual staff expertise.
    + therefore: Generosity of Spirit is contradicted by workflow burden.

  + therefore: The projection of institutional identity into actual behaviour
                reveals the productive tensions that Slide 3’s transformation 
                pattern must address.

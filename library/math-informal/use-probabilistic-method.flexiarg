! conclusion:
  Prove existence by showing a random object has the desired property with positive probability.

  + context: You want to show that an object with certain combinatorial properties exists, but
    explicit construction seems intractable.
  + IF:
      The desired property can be expressed as an event in a probability space on the set of
      candidate objects, and you can estimate the probability of failure.

  + HOWEVER:
      The probabilistic method typically does not produce an explicit object. It proves existence
      without construction. For applications requiring an actual witness, derandomisation
      techniques may be needed.

  + THEN:
      Define a probability distribution on candidate objects. Show that the probability of
      having the desired property is positive (by union bound, expectation argument, Lovász
      local lemma, or second moment method). Conclude existence.

  + BECAUSE:
      Erdős's probabilistic method revolutionised combinatorics by proving the existence of
      objects (Ramsey graphs, codes, expanders) that no one could construct explicitly. The
      expected value alone often suffices: if the expected number of bad events is less than 1,
      a good object exists.

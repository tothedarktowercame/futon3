! conclusion:
  Prove something locally (on small pieces) and then assemble the local results into a global one.

  + context: You want to establish a property of a large or complicated object.
  + IF:
      The object admits a decomposition into simpler pieces (open cover, partition, filtration,
      localisation at primes), and the property you want can be checked on pieces.

  + HOWEVER:
      Not every property is local. You must verify that local data can be patched: the pieces
      must be compatible on overlaps, and the patching procedure must not introduce new problems.

  + THEN:
      Cover the object with pieces where the property is manageable. Prove it on each piece.
      Check compatibility on overlaps. Glue the local results into a global one, using
      partitions of unity, sheaf conditions, or patching lemmas as appropriate.

  + BECAUSE:
      Local-to-global is one of the deepest recurring themes in mathematics: sheaf theory,
      Mayer-Vietoris, local-global principles in number theory, partitions of unity in
      differential geometry. The power comes from reducing a hard global problem to many
      easy local ones.

    next[Verify the property on each piece.]
    next[Check compatibility and assemble the global result.]

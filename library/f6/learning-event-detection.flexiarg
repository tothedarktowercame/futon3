! conclusion:
  Detect learning events by tracking when new technical terms appear in a user's
  contributions, then measure the causal effect of social interactions (answers,
  comments, corrections) on these events using an impulse-damping model.

  + context: You are measuring whether mathematical Q&A interactions cause learning,
    using the same method Corneli (2014, Chapter 6) applied to PlanetMath edit histories
    — now scaled to all of Stack Exchange using the 19,236-term NER kernel.
  + IF:
      Stack Exchange data dumps include full revision histories for every post, with
      timestamps. Each user has an observable vocabulary trajectory: the set of NER
      kernel terms they have used, growing over time. Social interactions (receiving
      an answer, a comment, an edit to one's question) are timestamped treatment events.
      A "learning event" is any post edit or new post in which a user introduces a
      technical term they have never used before.

  + HOWEVER:
      A new term in a user's output may be exposition (copying from a textbook) rather
      than genuine learning. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model cannot distinguish these.
      High-frequency posters will show more "learning events" by volume alone. The
      method requires careful per-user normalization and distinguishing treatment from
      confound (did the user learn from the SE interaction, or from an external source
      between posts?).

  + THEN:
      For each SE user with sufficient history (N posts > threshold): extract their
      term vocabulary trajectory using the NER kernel. Identify learning events (first
      use of each term). Identify treatment events (answers received, comments received,
      accepted answers on their questions). Fit the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck impulse-damping
      model: does a treatment event produce a detectable impulse in learning-event rate,
      and how quickly does it damp? Compare across difficulty strata and topic clusters.

  + BECAUSE:
      Corneli (2014) demonstrated this method on 445 PlanetMath users over 9 years
      (8,051 forum posts, 14,064 corrections, 3,867 learning-event edits). The method
      is classical — no GPU, no LLM — and scales linearly with corpus size. SE has
      orders of magnitude more data. If the same impulse-damping dynamics appear in
      SE that appeared in PlanetMath, it validates the thesis's model of peer-produced
      peer learning at scale. The fitted parameters then become a baseline for the
      Artificial Stack Exchange: do agent interactions produce the same learning
      dynamics as human interactions?

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Extract user edit histories from math.SE data dump (available after M-f6-ingest).]
    next[Run NER kernel term spotting per-user to build vocabulary trajectories.]
    next[Fit Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model to treatment→learning-event sequences; compare parameters with Corneli (2014) Table.]
    next[Use fitted human-learning parameters as a benchmark for M-f6-agents: do artificial agents exhibit similar impulse-damping dynamics?]

! conclusion:
  tag every prototype with a maturity level (:stub, :greenfield, :active, :settled) and define evidence-based promotion criteria; demote when evidence contradicts the claimed level

  + context: Prototypes evolve through stages. Without explicit maturity tracking, readers cannot tell which are speculative vs. battle-tested.
  + IF:
    devmap prototypes progress from initial idea through implementation to stable operation

  + HOWEVER:
    without explicit maturity tags, all prototypes look equally authoritative; stubs masquerade as proven, settled work gets re-litigated

  + THEN:
    tag every prototype with a maturity level (:stub, :greenfield, :active, :settled) and define evidence-based promotion criteria; demote when evidence contradicts the claimed level

  + BECAUSE:
    dhammavicaya requires knowing what you're investigating; maturity tags make the epistemic status of each prototype explicit and auditable

  + MATURITY-LEVELS:
    :stub - idea captured, no implementation yet
    :greenfield - implementation begun, not yet testable end-to-end
    :active - runs end-to-end, actively used but not yet battle-tested
    :settled - battle-tested, stable, ready for downstream dependents

  + PROMOTION-CRITERIA:
    :stub → :greenfield - code exists, can be invoked (even if incomplete)
    :greenfield → :active - runs end-to-end in at least 3 sessions with PSR/PUR logs
    :active → :settled - 10+ successful uses, >80% success rate, no regressions in 2 weeks

  + DEMOTION-TRIGGERS:
    - Success rate drops below 50% over 10 uses → demote one level
    - Breaking change without migration path → demote to :greenfield
    - Abandoned >3 months without maintenance → demote to :stub

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Audit all devmap prototypes and add :maturity tags where missing.]
    next[Add :evidence-for-greenfield, :evidence-for-active, :evidence-for-settled fields to each prototype.]
    next[Wire maturity changes into sidecar logs so promotions/demotions are auditable.]

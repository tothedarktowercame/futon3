! conclusion: Claims require grounding; an agent that asserts without evidence cannot be audited or trusted.
  + context: An agent makes claims about what it did, what it found, or what is true.
  + IF:
    The agent's outputs need to be verifiable by other agents, humans, or future selves.
  + HOWEVER:
    Assertions without anchors are indistinguishable from confabulation. Observers cannot tell if the agent is reporting reality or generating plausible-sounding noise.
  + THEN:
    Require every substantive claim to point to evidence: a file path, a trace event, a test result, a quotation. Make "unsupported claim" a detectable violation, not just a style preference.
  + BECAUSE:
    Evidence transforms agent output from "trust me" to "check this." It enables verification, correction, and cumulative trust-building.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Identify claim types in your agent's output (facts, completions, diagnoses).
    - For each type, define what counts as adequate evidence.
    - Add validation that flags claims missing their evidence anchors.

! conclusion:
  Human validation of AI-proposed reasoning cues is required to identify
  genuine structure and avoid false signals; the project treats AI as an
  experiment whose outputs are graded and logged, not as an automatic
  source of truth.

  + IF:
    The HDM canon already assumes that outline-level proposals are only
    trustworthy when human stewards can interrogate them and decide what
    stands, what changes, and what is discarded.

  + HOWEVER:
    If AI-generated segmentations and glosses are used without explicit
    records of where they were kept, edited, or rejected, the workflow
    cannot demonstrate that it is learning anything about the boundary
    between helpful and misleading explanations.

  + THEN:
    Use AI for first-pass segmentation and paraphrase, route each proposal
    through a ready/blocked-style decision record (accepted, revised,
    discarded), and treat staleness scans as alarms when drafts linger
    without review.

  + BECAUSE:
    Methodological validity in this setting depends on showing that human
    judgement governs every explanation and that the resulting log reveals
    which explanation types AI handles reliably and which remain beyond its
    current competence.

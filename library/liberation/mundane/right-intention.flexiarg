! conclusion: Cultivate thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness — replacing thoughts of sensuality, malice, and cruelty with their opposites.
  + context: This operates in the stream of thought, where mental formations shape perception and action. The quality of intention determines the direction of the path.
  + IF:
    The mind generates intentions constantly — some toward grasping, some toward ill will, some toward harm. These shape what we notice, how we interpret, what we do.
  + HOWEVER:
    Merely suppressing wrong intentions doesn't transform them. And "good" intentions can still involve subtle attachment — wanting to be seen as good, grasping at renunciation itself.
  + THEN:
    Cultivate the three right intentions: renunciation (releasing grasping, not acquiring more), good will (genuine wish for others' welfare), harmlessness (refraining from cruelty in thought). These are content-level intentions that redirect the stream.
  + BECAUSE:
    Mundane right intention is not wrong — it genuinely redirects mental activity away from harmful patterns. But it still involves identification with the intender and attachment to having good intentions. This is better than wrong intention but not yet liberation.
  + MUNDANE-CONTENT:
    - Renunciation: letting go of what doesn't serve
    - Good will: wishing well for others, including difficult others
    - Harmlessness: refraining from cruelty even in thought
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-WRONG-INTENTION:
    Wrong intention: sensuality (grasping pleasure), malice (wishing harm), cruelty (enjoying others' suffering)
    Mundane right intention: renunciation, good will, harmlessness — AND awareness that these too can be grasped
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Notice the quality of current intentions: grasping or releasing?
    - When malice arises, cultivate good will for that being specifically.
    - Track how intention-quality affects subsequent perception and action.
  + RIPENS-IN:
    Less conflict, less suffering caused, more capacity for generosity — but still within the world of intentions, still attached to being well-intentioned.

! conclusion: UKRN Horizon Bridge
+IF: Brookes belongs to UKRN, giving it a long-arc vantage on trustworthy, reproducible practice across the sector.
+HOWEVER: The UKRN lead sits far from day-to-day operations; without explicit ties to the Two Joes and Schools, horizon intelligence remains abstract and unused.
+THEN: Activate the UKRN lead as a horizon bridge: hold short quarterly altitude calls with PVC + ORPM, translate sector expectations into lightweight Bridge-Before-Portal moves (Story DOIs, licence narratives, shared templates), and cite UKRN alignment to justify incremental shifts rather than new committees.
+BECAUSE: When horizon signals are routed through the centerline, Brookes gains negentropic alignment—less reinvention, stronger credibility with funders/REF, and practical improvements that feel supportive rather than imposed.

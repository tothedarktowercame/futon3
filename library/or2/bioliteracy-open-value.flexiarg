! conclusion: Bioliteracy & Open Value
+IF: BMS teaching already runs hands-on, data-rich pedagogy that yields reusable datasets, notebooks, and protocols.
+HOWEVER: These artefacts stay siloed from research culture; teaching workloads are intense, data ethics complex, and open practice feels like “extra work.”
+THEN: Treat BMS as the north-node chariot bridging teaching and research. Use Fit-for-Use Stars to calibrate openness, bring Quality-by-Design Crowd techniques into labs, and add a Citizen Co-Learning track so students and communities follow real research logic and publish interpretable outputs.
+BECAUSE: When teaching artefacts are shared with calibrated openness, students gain researcher identity, BMS gains institutional visibility, and Brookes signals pedagogical excellence tied directly to Open Research value.

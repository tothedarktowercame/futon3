! conclusion: Log what works and what fails as patterns; otherwise the loop stalls.
  + context: New workflows surface edge cases and implicit assumptions.
  + IF:
    Realtime deviations are handled ad hoc and not recorded.
  + HOWEVER:
    Early iterations can be noisy and imperfect.
  + THEN:
    Record brief realtime patterns capturing “works well / doesn’t work,” then refine with evidence.
  + BECAUSE:
    Explicit learnings reduce repeated mistakes and speed calibration.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - evidence: add a realtime pattern after each notable failure or success.
    - evidence-shape: {:works-well [:string], :doesnt-work [:string], :evidence [:string]}

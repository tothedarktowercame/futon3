! conclusion: 以代理物件在不改動本體的情況下控制存取或行為。
  + context: A target object requires access control, caching, or remote indirection.
  + if: You need the same interface but want to add cross-cutting behavior.
  + however: Modifying the target mixes concerns and complicates testing.
  + then: Introduce a proxy that implements the same interface and delegates to the target while applying the extra behavior.
  + because: The proxy isolates policy while preserving substitutability.
  + next-steps:
    - Verify proxy and target are interface-compatible; test both cache hits and pass-through paths.
    - evidence-shape: {:proxy/name :string, :proxy/target :string, :proxy/policy [:string]}

FRUIT TRI-LAYER TABLE

Professional · Karmic · Somatic

Each fruit has three levels of meaning:

Professional (F1–F2)
— What it means in institutional / project / Brookes / work contexts.

Karmic (F5–F7)
— The deeper symbolic, nomadic, civilisational, pattern-level significance.

Somatic (F0)
— The felt sense in the body; the mindfulness anchor.

🍐 — Obligation
Professional (F1–F2)

Required action

Duty

Must-do item

Something with consequences if neglected

Externally mandated OR internally committed

“This is not optional”

Typical use:
Brookes deliverable, contractual duty, scheduled reporting, visa paperwork, OR a self-set obligation in the PAR (e.g., exercise, tai chi).

Karmic (F5–F7)

Karma-node demanding resolution

A promise requiring honour

A vow or bond

Dharma-duty

The “gravity well” of commitment

Obligation as a cord connecting actor and world

This maps beautifully to:

Buddhist samvara (ethical restraint / commitment)

Pattern debt

Story-arc necessitation

The inevitability of certain moves in the long arc of a life

Civilisational duties (F7) — e.g., lineage-preserving acts

In the nomadic-civilisation frame:

🍐 = the karmic cords that tie an individual to responsibilities across time.

Somatic (F0)

Weight on the shoulders or upper back

Sense of solidity / gravity

“I must carry this” feeling

Slight tightening around the diaphragm

Steadying pressure in the chest or spine

Somatically:
Obligation feels like an anchor-point — a stable, necessary load.

This fits futon0 perfectly: obligation is often misread as avoidance or stress, but can be recognised as a noble weight when somatically understood.

🍌 — Indicator
Professional (F1–F2)

Metric

Key performance indicator

Evidence

A sign that something is happening

Early warning OR positive signal

Something that should be logged, tracked, updated

Typical use:
KPIs, OKRs, data points, survey returns, monthly stats, or usage metrics for a prototype.

Karmic (F5–F7)

Dharma sign

Emergent pattern

A “marker” that reveals directionality of karma

Recurring motif in a storyline

A signpost in the long arc

A synchronistic or symbolic “event” that draws attention

In narrative terms:

🍌 = the breadcrumb trail of meaning.

In F7 (post-state civilisation):

It’s how nomadic groups track environmental, social, or epistemic signals.

It’s a system of noticing.

In F6 (war machine):

It’s how reasoning systems detect shifts in coherence.

A sign of “pressure points.”

Somatic (F0)

A little pulse of attention

A “ping” sensation — very light

Momentary brightening

A flick of awareness like a small bell

Something in the eyes (micro widening)

Somatically:
Indicators feel like micro-awakenings, little dings of consciousness — perfect for futon0.

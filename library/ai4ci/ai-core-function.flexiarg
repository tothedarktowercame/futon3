! conclusion:
  Understand that AI is deployed to surface dual-layer proof structures—formal
  steps plus validated informal cues and candidate pattern fragments—not to mint
  new proofs.

  + context: You are defining the core role of AI in surfacing dual-layer proof structures.

  + if:
    HDM patterns already prove that outline-first capture plus dialogue keeps
    mathematical reasoning legible to humans and agents.

  + however:
    Transport layers currently record only cleaned events; without AI-assisted
    extraction of informal phrases tied to symbolic steps, downstream systems
    receive nothing new to learn from.

  + then:
    Use AI to propose drafts that align outline nodes with informal cues and
    hypothesised proof-pattern descriptors, seeding entity/definition lists from
    open mathematical corpora (e.g., PlanetMath) so proposals start with
    meaningful vocabulary; attach MUSN provenance, and hand the drafts to human
    reviewers for acceptance or rejection before ledgering.

  + because:
    This keeps the project grounded in evidence: every retained explanation or
    pattern fragment has a traceable transport record, satisfying the ledger
    discipline and producing data future systems can trust.

f0/p0	lape	系统	System Vitality Indicators -> lape/系统: Indicators remain sustainable only when they create no friction. A minimal interface built from pre-existing behavioural traces provides consistent, low-noise signals that prevent hidden imbalance from migrating up-stack.	system, vitality, indicators, f0, p0, remain, sustainable, only, when, create
f0/p1	musi	弓	Epistemic Rhythm & Salients -> musi/弓: A stable epistemic rhythm prevents unbounded cognitive load *and makes life feel lighter, more joyful, and more tractable*. When salients reappear on schedule and WIP remains bounded, drift does not accumulate and affect settles.	epistemic, rhythm, salients, f0, p1, stable, prevents, unbounded, cognitive, load
f0/p2	sijelo	业	Core Obligations Contract -> sijelo/业: Upholding alignment and constraints at the base prevents the entire FUTON stack from drifting into incoherence or overload. When obligations, health, and review practices stay grounded, forward movement becomes stable and real.	core, obligations, contract, f0, p2, upholding, alignment, constraints, base, prevents
f0/p3	lon	叉	Ambition 0 Meta-Managed Infrastructure -> lon/叉: This layer provides the Markov blanket through which alignment can improve. Prototype 3 acts as the experience-design prototype of FUTON3: it raises signals, surfaces proto-patterns, and increases representational variety, while FUTON3 will later formalise this as proof-theoretic salience certification.	ambition, 0, meta, managed, infrastructure, f0, p3, layer, provides, markov
f0/p4	monsi	习	Ambition 1 Hyperreal Enterprises Practice -> monsi/习: This turns consulting into an alignment engine: work generates reusable structure, structure generates higher variety, and higher variety increases your future alignment opportunities. Hyperreal becomes evolutionary rather than transactional.	ambition, 1, hyperreal, enterprises, practice, f0, p4, turns, consulting, alignment
f0/p5	musi	用	Ambition 2 FUTON–Arxana Stack Stewardship -> musi/用: Frequent contact and lightweight documentation prevent drift and make the system stronger over time. This keeps FUTON–Arxana evolving into a stable, coherent environment rather than an abandoned prototype.	ambition, 2, futon, arxana, stack, stewardship, f0, p5, frequent, contact
f0/p6	musi	弓	Ambition 3 Mojo, Evolving Variety, + Reflective Rhythm -> musi/弓: These brief encounters act as evolutionary impulses: they expand perspective, refresh the generative model, and increase adaptive variety. This introduces just enough uncertainty to stimulate growth without destabilising the system.	ambition, 3, mojo, evolving, variety, reflective, rhythm, f0, p6, these
f0/p7	open	口	Ambition 4 Role Transition Trajectory -> open/口: Futons influence the present something like photons. The co-evolution of present and future echoes Gotama’s dependent causality—agent and future conditions arise together in a logical chain—and Alan Moore’s insight that all times are immediately accessible in certain states of consciousness. In applied futon theory, alignment grows through co-evolution with virtual states, not through selection or prediction.	ambition, 4, role, transition, trajectory, f0, p7, futons, influence, present
f0/p8	seme	广	Stack Coverage Check -> seme/广: FUTON0 provides the experiential ground—a mindful openness to futons— while FUTON3 handles representational coherence. Without the former, FUTON3 cannot see; without the latter, FUTON0’s perceptions cannot stabilise. Together, they keep the stack aligned across time.	stack, coverage, check, f0, p8, futon0, provides, experiential, ground, mindful
f1/p0	walo	四	Baseline Deterministic Substrate -> walo/四: A clear baseline makes the substrate’s guarantees explicit, helps detect regressions in hydration or pipeline flow, and provides a stable reference against which future refinements or extensions can be evaluated.	baseline, deterministic, substrate, f1, p0, clear, makes, s, guarantees, explicit
f1/p1	lape	每	Demo/Client Determinism & Focus-Header Instrumentation -> lape/每: Treating the demo/client workflow as calibrated instrumentation—rather than an informal demo—provides a stable, reproducible surface for higher futons, lets developers detect drift in persistence or header logic, and clarifies exactly what guarantees FUTON1 provides.	demo, client, determinism, focus, header, instrumentation, f1, p1, treating, workflow
f1/p10	musi	已	World-State Access & Storage Model Documentation -> musi/已: A clear storage-model contract makes FUTON1 a dependable foundation for the rest of the FUTON stack. It allows external tools to read and reason over the same durable world state without special-case integrations or export modes, preserving determinism and reducing the risk of accidental divergence.	world, state, access, storage, model, documentation, f1, p10, clear, contract
f1/p11	poka	才	Reproducible Pilot Workflows -> poka/才: Experimental and reasoning-oriented futons (e.g., FUTON2, FUTON4, FUTON5) require a stable, deterministic backend for storing and replaying world state. By documenting how pilots can rely on FUTON1’s storage and hydration guarantees, FUTON1 supports reproducible experimentation without expanding its own scope.	reproducible, pilot, workflows, f1, p11, experimental, reasoning, oriented, futons, e
f1/p12	pini	末	Consolidation & Packaging Pass -> pini/末: A coherent packaging of FUTON1 strengthens its role as the dependable base layer for higher futons and for collaborators who rely on deterministic behaviour but may not know the internal architecture. Clear organisation reduces friction, supports reproducibility, and makes FUTON1 easier to maintain as a stable substrate.	consolidation, packaging, pass, f1, p12, coherent, futon1, strengthens, its, role
f1/p2	lawa	申	NLP Interface Consolidation -> lawa/申: A consolidated and documented NLP interface provides a stable grounding for ingest and demo/client workflows, reduces accidental coupling, and makes it easier to extend or revise individual stages without destabilising the rest of FUTON1.	nlp, interface, consolidation, f1, p2, consolidated, documented, provides, stable, grounding
f1/p3	lape	已	Graph-Memory API & Seed Graph -> lape/已: A clear graph-memory contract turns FUTON1’s internal schema and store logic into a reliable interface. This allows higher futons and external tools to depend on the same graph representation, reduces ambiguity about what is persisted, and makes changes to the underlying storage behaviour visible and deliberate.	graph, memory, api, seed, f1, p3, clear, contract, turns, futon1
f1/p4	lili	分	XTDB Operations & REPL Workflows -> lili/分: Consolidating XTDB operations into clear, reusable workflows reduces friction, makes store inspection more consistent, and strengthens FUTON1’s role as a deterministic storage substrate rather than an opaque backend. Developers gain a predictable way to understand how mutations appear in XTDB and how hydration restores them.	xtdb, operations, repl, workflows, f1, p4, consolidating, clear, reusable, reduces
f1/p5	open	开	Open-World Ingest Workflows -> open/开: Consistent traces across CLI and API let FUTON1 evaluate NLP changes deterministically and produce reusable “knowledge graph” snapshots per session. Recording these plans keeps the work visible without derailing core storage duties.	open, world, ingest, workflows, f1, p5, consistent, traces, across, cli
f1/p6	ala	无	Thematic Clusters & Intent Metadata -> ala/无: Lightweight thematic metadata strengthens FUTON1’s role as an inspectable storage substrate. By keeping the taxonomy small and deterministic, FUTON1 avoids embedding inference or policy while still providing structured signals that higher futons may use for reasoning or pattern-based behaviour.	thematic, clusters, intent, metadata, f1, p6, lightweight, strengthens, futon1, s
f1/p7	anu	资料	CLI Ergonomics & Multi-Instance Isolation -> anu/资料: Clear ergonomics and isolation practices make FUTON1 safer to embed in tooling and CI workflows, reduce accidental data mixing, and strengthen the determinism and reproducibility guarantees laid out in FUTON1’s IFR.	cli, ergonomics, multi, instance, isolation, f1, p7, clear, practices, make
f1/p8	lili	不要	Golden Scripts & Determinism Checks -> lili/不要: A compact, well-chosen golden suite makes FUTON1’s determinism guarantees explicit, stabilises expectations about performance, and turns the substrate into a measurable layer rather than an informal demonstration.	golden, scripts, determinism, checks, f1, p8, compact, well, chosen, suite
f1/p9	lipu	无	External Client & API Contract Clarification -> lipu/无: A clear, documented API surface allows external tools to rely on FUTON1’s deterministic storage and summarisation behaviour without embedding orchestration logic. This strengthens FUTON1’s role as a stable substrate while avoiding scope creep into agent design or protocol negotiation.	external, client, api, contract, clarification, f1, p9, clear, documented, surface
f2/p0	walo	四	AIF Stack Baseline (observe → perceive → affect → core) -> walo/四: A documented baseline prevents accidental drift before you optimise policy, analyzers, or mechanics.	aif, stack, baseline, observe, perceive, affect, core, f2, p0, documented
f2/p1	moku	田	Observation Layer Hardening -> moku/田: Reliable observations keep perception and policy stable no matter the world configuration.	observation, layer, hardening, f2, p1, reliable, observations, keep, perception, policy
f2/p10	nimi	乡	Curriculum Scenarios & AIF Behaviour Cards -> nimi/乡: These cards seed pattern extraction and future training systems.	curriculum, scenarios, aif, behaviour, cards, f2, p10, these, seed, pattern
f2/p11	mu	由	AIF Agent Debugger & Mu/Precision Visualiser -> mu/由: Visual insight accelerates iteration and debugging.	aif, agent, debugger, mu, precision, visualiser, f2, p11, visual, insight
f2/p12	pini	末	Year-End Packaging & Story -> pini/末: Strong packaging turns FUTON2 into a reusable, inspectable module inside the full FUTON stack.	year, end, packaging, story, f2, p12, strong, turns, futon2, reusable
f2/p13	monsi	乃	Graph Memory Adapter & Agent ABI -> monsi/乃: once the adapter honours shared trail/pheromone energy, human proofwork and AIF runs guide each other through the same mission record instead of bespoke glue.	graph, memory, adapter, agent, abi, f2, p13, once, honours, shared
f2/p14	wawa	习	Viriya Field & Social Activation Metrics -> wawa/习: Tying the simulation to viriya turns FUTON2 into a practice accelerator instead of a curiosity.	viriya, field, social, activation, metrics, f2, p14, tying, simulation, turns
f2/p15	insa	内	Sandbox Bridge & Presence Interface -> insa/内: This proves that AIF agents can show up wherever proofwork happens, not just inside a war grid.	sandbox, bridge, presence, interface, f2, p15, proves, aif, agents, show
f2/p16	ala	无	Lobby Bus & MUSN Intake -> ala/无: This proves that a single HUD-bound agent can safely “step into” MUSN through a constrained door—acting as a semi-privileged clerk rather than an all-powerful daemon—and sets the pattern for later extending the presence bus (Prototype 15) to multiple rooms and multiple authenticated agent writers.	lobby, bus, musn, intake, f2, p16, proves, single, hud, bound
f2/p16	kin	去	Wisdom Trail Harvest & Pattern Seeding -> kin/去: Shared missions keep the “energy” loop tight between simulations and human proofwork.	wisdom, trail, harvest, pattern, seeding, f2, p16, shared, missions, keep
f2/p2	monsi	乡	Predictive Coding Microcycle Clarity -> monsi/乡: Clear cycles make later integrations with futon4 symbolic memory far easier.	predictive, coding, microcycle, clarity, f2, p2, clear, cycles, make, later
f2/p3	sewi	六	Hunger & Precision Dynamics Goldens -> sewi/六: Once goldens exist, small tune-ups stop breaking entire colony behaviour.	hunger, precision, dynamics, goldens, f2, p3, once, exist, small, tune
f2/p4	moku	乡	Policy Layer Surfacing -> moku/乡: Stabilised policies are mandatory before benchmarking or bridging into futon1 salience services.	policy, layer, surfacing, f2, p4, stabilised, policies, mandatory, before, benchmarking
f2/p5	alasa	书	World Mechanics Contract (war.clj) -> alasa/书: A clear contract keeps the world trustworthy when other prototypes depend on it for episodes.	world, mechanics, contract, war, clj, f2, p5, clear, keeps, trustworthy
f2/p6	tan	已	Live Analyzer & Pivot Stream Stabilisation -> tan/已: Pivot streams are FUTON2’s event bus and must behave like a stable ABI.	live, analyzer, pivot, stream, stabilisation, f2, p6, streams, futon2, s
f2/p7	taso	三	Classic vs AIF Benchmark Suite -> taso/三: FUTON2 should function as a scientific system with reproducible metrics.	classic, vs, aif, benchmark, suite, f2, p7, futon2, function, scientific
f2/p8	pana	予	External Control & Episode Export -> pana/予: Exported episodes are critical for agent training, memory, and pattern extraction.	external, control, episode, export, f2, p8, exported, episodes, critical, agent
f2/p9	monsi	刊	futon1 ↔ futon2 Alignment Layer -> monsi/刊: a working bridge proves ants can reason over the same facts as the rest of the stack.	futon1, futon2, alignment, layer, f2, p9, working, bridge, proves, ants
f3/p0	tawa	无	Flexiformal Transport Baseline -> tawa/无: Flexiformal checking needs a stable log format before any higher-layer reasoning can rely on it.	flexiformal, transport, baseline, f3, p0, checking, needs, stable, log, format
f3/p1	taso	本	Pattern Canon & Standard Library -> taso/本: Without a canonical pattern store, the checker has nothing trustworthy to compare against: our understanding of "inference" is based on associations between the "if/however → then" inside patterns: we need to be able to check any action that's made relative to the codebase against these patterns to know if it counts as progress.	pattern, canon, standard, library, f3, p1, without, canonical, store, checker
f3/p2	kepeken	甲	Similarity Field & Fake Embedding -> kepeken/甲: Pattern suggestion quality underpins the flexiformal workflow and must be inspectable.	similarity, field, fake, embedding, f3, p2, pattern, suggestion, quality, underpins
f3/p3	pini	末	Applicability Engine & Check DSL -> pini/末: Turning patterns into executable checks is what makes FUTON3 “flexiformal” rather than just narrative.	applicability, engine, check, dsl, f3, p3, turning, patterns, executable, checks
f3/p4	pali	乃	Trail & Proof-State Journal -> pali/乃: In Kolmogorov’s sense, a proof is a construction of an object; here, each trail step is a constructive proof step that builds a pattern-typed object whose canonical form is its (fruit, orb) type. Typing steps like “🍌→🔵” lets you distinguish “this is just a check” from “this is an indicator that actually preserves the virtue invariant,” and salience separates merely valid rules from those that are central to your meta-theory in practice.	trail, proof, state, journal, f3, p4, kolmogorov, s, sense, construction
f3/p5	pali	氏	Workday Instrumentation & aob-chatgpt Bridge -> pali/氏: This is how empowered action (“joy”) becomes measurable proof progress and how role responsibilities stay legible.	workday, instrumentation, aob, chatgpt, bridge, f3, p5, how, empowered, action
f3/p6	luka	已	Pattern Creation Workbench -> luka/已: FUTON3 should not just consume the library; it should propose expansions grounded in lived work while signalling when drafts can be trusted.	pattern, creation, workbench, f3, p6, futon3, just, consume, library, propose
f3/p7	tenpo	力	Joy-as-Empowered-Action Metrics -> tenpo/力: Empowered action is the KPI for this futon.	joy, empowered, action, metrics, f3, p7, kpi, futon, track, time

f3/p9	tan	氏	Proof Training Ground (“Flexiformal Agent Sandbox”) -> tan/氏: Storytelling plus an explicit training ground turns FUTON3 into a reproducible service that upstream layers (FUTON6, FUTON7) can consume and steward.	proof, training, ground, flexiformal, agent, sandbox, f3, p9, storytelling, plus
f4/p1	ala	久	Arxana Reboot (Week-long target) -> ala/久: A functioning editor is the precondition for all downstream memory work.	arxana, reboot, week, long, target, f4, p1, functioning, editor, precondition

f4/p12	pini	末	Year-End Synthesis -> pini/末: This sets the stage for FUTON5+.	year, end, synthesis, f4, p12, sets, stage, futon5, run, full
f4/p2	ala	无	Graph Memory (Datascript) -> ala/无: without a living graph memory, Arxana never escapes editor cosplay.	graph, memory, datascript, f4, p2, without, living, arxana, never, escapes

f4/p5	open	门	Multi-user Memory (MUSN revival) -> open/门: This will open the door to multi-agent co-reasoning and shared prototyping.	multi, user, memory, musn, revival, f4, p5, open, door, agent
f4/p6	sona	久	Argumentarium / Scholium Mode -> sona/久: This becomes the living mathematical-philosophical substrate.	argumentarium, scholium, mode, f4, p6, becomes, living, mathematical, philosophical, substrate
f4/p7	tenpo	久	XTDB Integration -> tenpo/久: This turns Arxana into a serious memory engine.	xtdb, integration, f4, p7, turns, arxana, serious, memory, engine, rekey

f4/p9	ala	叉	StackExchange Import -> ala/叉: seeding the memory with curated Q/A pairs gives Arxana instant argumentative density.	stackexchange, import, f4, p9, seeding, memory, curated, q, pairs, gives
f5/p0	kalama	习	Nonstarter Frame (Concentration without Teleology) -> kalama/习: Without a stable concentrator layer, FUTON4’s tranquility and FUTON6’s argument power cannot synergise.	nonstarter, frame, concentration, without, teleology, f5, p0, stable, concentrator, layer
f5/p1	sin	归	Patterns of Improvisation (Music ⇄ Math ⇄ CT) -> sin/归: Without a sigil-indexed transformation alphabet, FUTON5 lacks executable concentration mechanics. With it, sigils become active operators—an RNA engine capable of transforming DNA-patterns from FUTON4 into living, improvisable forms.	patterns, improvisation, music, math, ct, f5, p1, without, sigil, indexed
f5/p2	wawa	习	Concentration Engine (Chops, Not Goals) -> wawa/习: Concentration emerges from rhythm, not obligation.	concentration, engine, chops, goals, f5, p2, emerges, rhythm, obligation, establish
f5/p3	toki	世	Pattern Library (Post-Flexiarg) -> toki/世: FUTON5 needs a pattern substrate that can plug directly into FUTON6’s argument logic.	pattern, library, post, flexiarg, f5, p3, futon5, needs, substrate, plug

f7/p3	monsi	引	Amazon-Breaker Function -> monsi/引: Anti-monopoly structural feedback must be designed in from the start; otherwise F7 collapses back into the state form.	amazon, breaker, function, f7, p3, anti, monopoly, structural, feedback, designed

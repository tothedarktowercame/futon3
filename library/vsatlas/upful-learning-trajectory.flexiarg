! conclusion:
  Design the manifold so contributors progress from authors → collective members → FLOSS contributors → maintainers via explicit scaffolds.

  + context: You are designing participation pathways so contributors can grow into maintainers, ensuring the ecosystem renews itself over time. This does not apply when the community is intentionally short-lived.
  + IF:
    Platforms with only a few maintainers stagnate and collapse when those maintainers depart.

  + HOWEVER:
    Contributors remain single-use authors with no path toward deeper participation.

  + THEN:
    Design the manifold so contributors progress from authors → collective members → FLOSS contributors → maintainers via explicit scaffolds.

  + BECAUSE:
    An upful learning trajectory produces a self-renewing ecosystem capable of adaptation and long-term stewardship.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Map the current contributor ladder and identify the first missing rung.]
    next[Draft one scaffold per rung (roles, permissions, mentorship).]
    next[Define progression signals (e.g., % of contributors advancing) and a failure signal (e.g., drop-off after first rung).]

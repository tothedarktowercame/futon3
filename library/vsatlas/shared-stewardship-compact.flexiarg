! conclusion:
  Articulate a shared stewardship compact that clarifies which parts of VSATLAS are commons (open protocols, core code), which are services (facilitation, training, customisation), and how partners can participate in governance over time.

  + context: You are defining how ownership, responsibility, and governance are shared so partners can commit to a shared effort, without relying on a single founder or lab.
  + IF:
    Early-stage platforms often rely on one or two overburdened founders who are expected to be visionaries, engineers, salespeople, and custodians.

  + HOWEVER:
    Concentrating all ownership and responsibility undermines resilience and makes partners wary of long-term dependence on a single individual or lab.

  + THEN:
    Articulate a shared stewardship compact that clarifies which parts of VSATLAS are commons (open protocols, core code), which are services (facilitation, training, customisation), and how partners can participate in governance over time.

  + BECAUSE:
    A clear compact reassures institutions, invites co-ownership, and aligns the business model with the manifold’s deeper claim: that worlds worth living in are co-created and co-stewarded.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Draft the compact as a one-page charter and circulate to anchor partners.]
    next[Define a first governance checkpoint and the decision rights it covers.]

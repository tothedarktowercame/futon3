! conclusion: Apply the four right efforts — preventing unarisen unwholesome states, abandoning arisen unwholesome states, cultivating unarisen wholesome states, maintaining arisen wholesome states.
  + context: This operates in the ongoing work of mental cultivation. Progress requires sustained energy applied in the right directions — neither burning out nor stagnating.
  + IF:
    The mind tends toward habit-patterns. Without deliberate effort, unwholesome states proliferate and wholesome states decay. Change requires energy.
  + HOWEVER:
    Effort can become striving — tight, driven, exhausting. And effort toward "being good" can itself become attachment. The problem is not effort but misdirected or grasping effort.
  + THEN:
    Practice the four right efforts: (1) prevent unwholesome states not yet arisen, (2) abandon unwholesome states already arisen, (3) develop wholesome states not yet arisen, (4) maintain wholesome states already arisen. This is the content of mundane right effort.
  + BECAUSE:
    Mundane right effort creates conditions for mental transformation — without effort, change doesn't happen. But one can apply effort while still attached to progress, to being a "good practitioner," to achieving states. This is better than wrong effort but not yet liberation.
  + MUNDANE-CONTENT:
    - Preventing: noticing conditions that give rise to unwholesome, not creating them
    - Abandoning: when unwholesome arises, not feeding it, letting it pass
    - Developing: creating conditions for wholesome to arise
    - Maintaining: when wholesome is present, sustaining the conditions
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-WRONG-EFFORT:
    Wrong effort: effort toward sensuality, ill will, cruelty; or no effort at all
    Mundane right effort: four right efforts — AND awareness that the effort itself can be grasped
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Notice which of the four is most needed now: preventing, abandoning, developing, maintaining?
    - Track when effort becomes striving or when relaxation becomes slackness.
    - Calibrate effort to conditions rather than to ambition.
  + RIPENS-IN:
    Mental clarity, reduced reactivity, more capacity for concentration — but still within the world of practitioners and practice, still attached to progress.
  + RELATED-PATTERNS:
    - liberation/noble/right-effort (the effort-faculty beyond content)
    - liberation/mundane/right-mindfulness (mindfulness monitors effort)

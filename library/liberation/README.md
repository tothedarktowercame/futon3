# Liberation Patterns (The Eightfold Path)

Patterns for maintaining flexibility and responsiveness in the learning loop.

## Core Insight

**Control patterns protect the loop from external attack; liberation patterns protect it from internal calcification.**

The same frame that once served learning can become a prison when it hardens into certainty. Liberation patterns address this by treating all frames — even valid ones — as provisional instruments rather than fixed truths.

## The Two Tiers (MN 117)

Following the Mahācattārīsakasutta (The Great Forty), each path factor has two forms:

| Tier | Pali | Description | Result |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Mundane** | sāsava puññabhāgiya | Accompanied by defilements, partakes of good deeds | Good rebirth, not liberation |
| **Noble** | ariya anāsava lokuttara | Noble, undefiled, transcendent, factor of path | Liberation |

### The Key Distinction

- **Mundane**: Right *content* — holding good views, intending well, speaking truly, acting skillfully
- **Noble**: Right *faculty* — the wisdom/thinking/abstaining/effort/mindfulness/concentration faculty operating in one "intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled"

Mundane right view: "I hold good, provisional frames"
Noble right view: The wisdom faculty seeing clearly, without an I holding anything

## The Three Trainings

### Wisdom (Prajñā)
| Factor | Mundane | Noble |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Right View | Holding provisional frames about causation, karma, consequences | The wisdom faculty operating — capacity to see, not content seen |
| Right Intention | Cultivating renunciation, good will, harmlessness | The thinking faculty placing and directing, intent on undefiled |

### Ethical Conduct (Śīla)
| Factor | Mundane | Noble |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Right Speech | Refraining from lying, divisive, harsh, idle talk | The abstaining faculty — desisting, abstaining, refraining |
| Right Action | Refraining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct | The abstaining faculty operating in bodily domain |
| Right Livelihood | Avoiding harmful trades, manipulation for gain | The abstaining faculty in sustained patterns of support |

### Mental Discipline (Samādhi)
| Factor | Mundane | Noble |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Right Effort | Four strivings: prevent, abandon, develop, maintain | The striving faculty operating without exhaustible striver |
| Right Mindfulness | Four foundations: body, feelings, mind, phenomena | The mindfulness faculty monitoring path without monitor |
| Right Concentration | Four jhanas: absorption states of increasing refinement | "Unification of mind with seven factors as prerequisites" |

## The Running Circle

"Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness keep running and circling around" each factor:
- **View** understands what is wrong and right
- **Effort** works to abandon wrong and embrace right
- **Mindfulness** does so mindfully, monitoring progress

This applies explicitly to the first five factors. For the final three (effort, mindfulness, concentration) it is self-evident.

## The Great Forty

From MN 117, the "Great Forty" means:
- **20 on the side of the skillful**: 10 factors × (factor + qualities promoted)
- **20 on the side of the unskillful**: 10 wrong factors × (factor + qualities promoted)

The 10 factors:
1. Right View
2. Right Intention
3. Right Speech
4. Right Action
5. Right Livelihood
6. Right Effort
7. Right Mindfulness
8. Right Concentration
9. **Right Knowledge** (ñāṇa) — wisdom perfected, ending defilements
10. **Right Freedom** (vimutti) — liberation from rebirth

"The trainee has eight factors, while the perfected one has ten."

## Linear AND Circular

The path is **linear** — each factor arises from the previous:
```
View → Intention → Speech → Action → Livelihood → Effort → Mindfulness → Concentration → Knowledge → Freedom
```

But also **circular** — each factor supports all others:
```
View ←→ Effort ←→ Mindfulness
    ↘    ↓    ↙
      All factors
```

## Relationship to Control Patterns

| Control Pattern | Protects Against | Liberation Pattern | Protects Against |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| ward-off-boundary | Fabrication entry | right-effort | Burnout/stagnation |
| roll-back-hold | Premature adoption | right-speech | Closed feedback |
| press-mechanism | Decorative BECAUSE | right-view | Rigid explanation |
| push-warrant | Unjustified adoption | right-intention | Fixed goals |
| pluck-extract | Contaminated components | right-action | Irreversible intervention |
| split-isolate | Spreading contamination | right-livelihood | Extractive patterns |
| elbow-immediate | Active harm | right-mindfulness | Captured attention |
| lean-commit | Full fabrication | right-concentration | Fragmented/grasping awareness |

## Worn Away

For each factor: "For one of right X, wrong X is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong X are worn away. And because of right X, many skillful qualities are fully developed."

This is not suppression but **wearing away** (nijjiṇṇa) — gradual erosion through consistent practice, not forceful removal.

## Cannot Be Rolled Back

"This exposition of the teaching on the Great Forty has been rolled forth. And it cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world."

The structure is self-validating: criticizing it requires abandoning right view, which means praising wrong view.

## Implementation Notes

The mundane tier is what most practice looks like — and this is good, not inferior. Mundane right factors lead to better outcomes, reduced suffering, conditions for further practice.

The noble tier describes what happens when the factors operate in one "intent on the noble, intent on the undefiled" — where the content of the factor becomes transparent to the faculty itself. This cannot be manufactured but arises when conditions are ripe.

The patterns support practice at both tiers:
- Mundane: specific guidance on content (what to cultivate, what to avoid)
- Noble: pointers toward the faculty operating (what to notice when practice matures)

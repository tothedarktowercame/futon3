** Core Claim
A successful repository transition must begin from *who we are* and *what we are committed to*.

** Roles
  - Depositors
  - Downloaders (including external partners, supervisors, students, etc.)
  - Research Integrity & Governance
  - REF/Impact team
  - Archivists
  - ?

** Values

Inclusivity: “We celebrate, value, and provide equal opportunity to all.”
# → Pattern elicitation ensures visibility and participation.

Confidence: “We have confidence in our staff and students.”
# → Clear governance builds trust and good practice.

Enterprising creativity: “We’re adaptable and flexible; a fresh approach in everything we do.”
# → Pattern cycles = structured experimentation.

Connectedness: “Academic excellence is underpinned by learning by doing.”
# → Compatibility mapping strengthens collaboration and evidence flows.

Generosity of spirit: “Open and willing to share abilities, knowledge, and experience.”
# → Living pattern library; minimal-friction knowledge sharing.

** The current research repository
RADAR is currently one among many (GitHub, Zenodo, Figshare, OSF, Octopus, disciplinary archives such as Dryad, etc.)
  - ... in a ecosystem that increasingly prioritises *open research*.
  - ... and also one of many software systems at Brookes (Moodle, Panopto, ServiceNow, etc.)

** Input Summary
This identity sets the structural constraints for any credible transformation.

* INPUT — Brief Observations
** Invariants (true now and should be preserved in any transformation)
- *Plurality*: Multiple forms of contribution, use, and recognition
- *Trust*: data quality, rights metadata, ethical transparency
- *Creativity*: Reuse, interdisciplinarity, linking
- *Helpfulness*: User-friendly contribution pathways

** Diagnostics (motivating change!)

- Workarounds, tacit dependencies, brittle workflows, duplication of effort
- Uneven visibility, unclear reuse pathways
- Large data sets and “nontraditional outputs” that don’t thrive in RADAR
- REF risk accumulates when “people, culture, and environment” drift in different directions

* OUTPUT — Strawman Projection
:PROPERTIES:

** Core Claim
If we do nothing, current discrepancies will show up as systemic misalignment in the PCE portion of REF 2029.

** REF People, Culture & Environment: Some failure modes

- *“Strategy”*: reactive and ineffective planning → workflows that aren’t managed well
- *“Responsibility”*: unclear governance → inconsistencies regarding rights and reuse
- *“Connectivity”*: siloed or unusable deposits → brittle interdisciplinarity, little ecosystemic uptake
- *“Inclusivity”*: accessibility gaps; uneven representation of actual research diversity
- *“Development”*: training burden; reliance on librarian heroics

** Baseline Summary
Something along these lines is the “default future” if issues remain unaddressed.

* OUTPUT — The Research Emporium

** Core Claim
Taking compliance as the floor and research excellence as the ceiling,
the research repository can be an amazing asset to Brookes and a star
of the PCE.

** Core metaphor: Brookes Research Emporium
- Showcases Brookes’ intellectual portfolio
- Drives visibility, credibility, and external engagement
- Turns open research into a value generator, not a cost centre
- Aligns *Inclusivity*, *Enterprising Creativity*, and *Generosity of Spirit*

** Keep an eye on indicators of reuse:
- *Footfall*: depth and diversity of visitors
- *Portfolio exploration*: interdisciplinary browsing
- *Inbound calls*: collaboration, consultancy, CPD enquiries
- *Citation-motivated traffic and evidence of reuse*
- *Media/policy pick-up*: external resonance
- *Reduced training burden*: more intuitive workflows
- *Less stress*: fewer ad-hoc queries about rights, REF eligibility, embargoes

** Part of a much nicer PCE statement:

- *“Strategy”*: learning system replaces firefighting  
- *“Responsibility”*: governance becomes visible and light  
- *“Connectivity”*: workflows align across boundaries  
- *“Inclusivity”*: reflexivity drives representation  
- *“Development”*: capacity grows through practice

** Capability Summary
By doubling down on “intelligent openness” the repository becomes a significant *public-facing research asset*.

* PROCESS — The Transformation Engine

** Core Claim
INPUT → PROCESS → OUTPUT

≈

Identity → Projection → Capability


This can be read as a *repeatable cycle* that evolves Brookes research
infrastructure...
- safely, confidently, learning as we go.

** Step 1 — Zoom in on *Identity*
Not just who we want to be but also our annoyances, frustrations, etc.:

- resonances _and_ tensions :: e.g., “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”
- constraints _and_ pressures :: some shared (e.g., finance), some discipline-specific (e.g., data storage needs)

** Step 2 — Micro- *Projection*
Each “next step” should fit how collaborators actually work.

- Connect and build around the things that matter to people :: For most people it’s not a repository but their /task/, /care/, /practice/, /mission/, ...
- Build in a continuous improvement process :: real-time co-learning loops (e.g., librarians/RDM) vs parallel or more distant cycles (researchers/IT)
# and let’s face it: /survival/.

** Step 3 — Building *Capability*
Increase our ability to carry out and empower excellent research, e.g., through

- Transparent workflows and analytics where relevant
- Widening-out bottlenecks
- Less heroic labour
- Learning from the process!

** Step 4 — Iterate the above
What I have just talked through without using technical terminology is the concept of a /design pattern/.

- *IF* (“identity”) *HOWEVER* (there is still tension)
- *THEN* (take best practice guidance for such a situation /when it exists/ *or* develop such guidance empirically)
- *BECAUSE* (we should learn from what works!)

** PCE one more time:

- *“Strategy”*: Not “perfect” workflows, but diagnostic patterns that make tensions visible, tractable, and correctable.
- *“Responsibility”*: Pattern-based templates make governance clearer without bureaucracy or formal restructuring.
- *“Connectivity”*: Not a grand unified platform, but organic connection.
- *“Inclusivity”*: Inclusiveness operationalised through reflective practice, evaluation protocol, and participatory design.
- *“Development”*: Build on what worked best in the Open Research Programme: peer-led practice.

** Process Summary
This transformation plan works *because it uses (1) time-tested and (2) culturally fine-tuned patterns* while respecting identity, rhythm, difference, and connection.

** In Conclusion
A repository transition is best led using a lightweight, patterned
*identity → projection → capability* approach.

* ANNEX
:PROPERTIES:

** Strategy
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_class: slide
:END:
- Strategy becomes *iteratively adaptive*: each pattern cycle (diagnose → prototype → evaluate → re-ground) generates actionable evidence.
- Medium-term planning is structured around the *Transformation Engine* and backed by *compatibility maps* that clarify where cross-team interdependencies matter.
- Instead of lurching from fire to fire, the organisation moves into a mode where *strategic foresight and operational readiness reinforce each other*.

** Responsibility
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_class: slide
:END:

- Rights and responsibilities are expressed through *micro-governance patterns*
  (e.g., License Laddering, Institutional Drift reviews) that clarify who owns what decisions.
- Governance becomes *legible and teachable*, reducing incidental gatekeeping.
- Stewardship roles (e.g., pattern stewards, evidence stewards) are small, rotating,
  and embedded in normal practice rather than being heroic exceptions.

** Connectivity
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_class: slide
:END:

- Connectivity emerges from *interoperability-by-design*: compatibility mapping across units helps align expectations before infrastructure decisions are locked in.
- Patterned development generates *shared mental models* across disciplines, improving cross-team translation and reducing friction.
- Deposits and workflows are not “open by default” in a performative sense, but *integrative by pattern*: interactions and handoffs are deliberately designed.

** Inclusivity
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_class: slide
:END:

- Inclusivity is not an add-on; it’s baked into the *pattern elicitation process*, where lived experience becomes design evidence.
- Reflexive workshops ensure minority voices shape pattern revisions.
- The system becomes *locally accountable*: each cycle captures who is being served and who is being missed.

** Development
:PROPERTIES:
:reveal_class: slide
:END:

- Capability development becomes *embedded in workflow*, not delivered as extra labour.
- Patterns provide “minimum viable upskilling”: just enough structure to act,
  plus a safe cycle for review and adjustment.
- Expertise becomes *distributed*: knowledge resides in documented cycles
  and shared artefacts rather than in a small number of heroes.

*** Underlying mechanism
*Pattern cycle = structured evidence flow → better decisions → stronger culture.*

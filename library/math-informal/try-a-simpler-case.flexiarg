! conclusion:
  When a problem resists direct attack, try a simpler or smaller version first.

  + context: You are stuck on a problem whose generality or size makes it hard to see what is going on.
  + IF:
      The problem involves parameters (dimension, cardinality, degree, number of variables) and no
      direct approach is working.

  + HOWEVER:
      Jumping to the simplest case can miss structure that only appears at intermediate complexity,
      and results for small cases do not always generalise.

  + THEN:
      Reduce one or more parameters to the smallest non-trivial value. Solve that case. Examine what
      made it work and what would break if the parameter grew. Use the insight to guide the general
      argument.

  + BECAUSE:
      Simpler cases reveal the essential mechanism while hiding accidental complexity. Most successful
      general proofs were found by someone who first understood n=2 or dimension 1.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify which parameter to reduce.]
    next[Solve the reduced case completely.]
    next[Articulate what generalises and what does not.]

! conclusion: Declare the territory before entering it; unbounded scope makes progress unmeasurable.
  + context: An agent is about to begin work on a task that could touch many things.
  + IF:
    The agent needs to make progress that can be verified and bounded.
  + HOWEVER:
    Without declared scope, "done" is undefined, side effects are unpredictable, and observers cannot tell if the agent is on track or wandering.
  + THEN:
    Before substantive action, state the scope: what files, concepts, or regions are in-bounds; what is explicitly out-of-bounds; what the exit condition is. Treat scope violations as requiring explicit expansion, not silent drift. Scope defines the territory; budgets and pauses govern what happens inside it.
  + BECAUSE:
    Declared scope makes progress measurable, side effects auditable, and completion definable. It also protects the broader system from unintended changes.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Add scope declaration to your agent's initialization or planning phase.
    - Log scope boundaries and check actions against them.
    - Design a scope-expansion protocol for when legitimate work requires broadening.

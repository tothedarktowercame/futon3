! conclusion: Single-line messages transmit reliably; multi-line fragments do not.
  + context: IRC relays can split or interleave long multi-line messages.
  + IF:
    Messages contain newlines or multiple blocks that fragment on relay.
  + HOWEVER:
    Some content needs detail beyond a short line.
  + THEN:
    Send a single-line primary message with a short summary and attach details via files or structured events.
  + BECAUSE:
    A single-line payload preserves ordering and reduces lost context.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - evidence: message-length capped (~350 words) with no newlines.
    - evidence-shape: {:summary :string, :detail-ref :string}

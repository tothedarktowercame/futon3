@factor Mindful apprehension (sati + sampajañña)
@IFR: FUTON0 is the mindfulness and futon-perception layer: the lived,
experiential basis through which real-but-virtual futures (futons) become
intelligible via symbolic mediation. It stabilises vitality, rhythm, clarity,
and the conditions for “wondrous apprehension”. FUTON0 provides a
bio-mechanical interface to the extended cognitive architecture—the cybernetic
floor from which the whole FUTON stack perceives, adapts, and co-evolves with
its future.

@state Vitality telemetry is operational: the scanner, git activity pipeline,
and Zoom R4 ingest run end-to-end, and the Stack HUD is the Futon0 surface
(dedicated frame + context buffer) for vitality rows, boundary gaps, reminders,
and voice-typing controls. Stack HUD snapshots are logged over time (daily
JSONL plus compacted summaries). The data stores are still periodic JSON
snapshots wired via cron/systemd rather than a real-time shared state.

@next Maintain and develop minimal models of vitality signals; cultivate
periodic wondrous apprehension; and continue light futon-prototyping efforts
with steady awareness, so that both clear devmaps and concrete implementations
can emerge naturally.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 0 — System Vitality Indicators [💤/系统 🌏/市]

+ context:
  FUTON0 provides the minimal embodied/creative signals required for early
  detection of imbalance, while avoiding expansion of lifelogging overhead.

+ if:
  You want dependable early warning of drift in health, energy, or expressive rhythm.

+ however:
  Existing signals are scattered (notes, reminders, implicit habits) and
  therefore unreliable as a coherent early-warning interface.

+ then:
  Use only *existing traceable activity* as indicators: Tatami sessions,
  git commits, filesystem timestamps, and micro-recording cadence. Add one
  lightweight prompt-based behaviour: a weekly tai-chi intention check surfaced
  automatically by the FUTON3 HUD. No manual lifelogging is introduced.

+ because:
  Indicators remain sustainable only when they create no friction. A minimal
  interface built from pre-existing behavioural traces provides consistent,
  low-noise signals that prevent hidden imbalance from migrating up-stack.

+ evidence:
  - The FUTON0 clock already exists: Tatami/API chat sessions automatically
    emit timestamped events, providing a ground truth for daily activity.
  - Git commits, recording timestamps, and filesystem modification times supply
    ambient movement/engagement signals with zero added logging.
  - FUTON1 work-session tags already show >90% end-of-session coverage.

+ next:
  Build the cron-based vitality scanner; implement the weekly tai-chi HUD prompt;
  run a 30–45 day pilot to stabilise thresholds; and refine the vitality
  interface only after reviewing correlations with mood, focus, and WIP drift.

  + next-evidence:
    - Extend the cron scanner to generate a daily summary of filesystem
      activity, recording cadence, and Tatami timestamps.
    - Capture tai-chi intention Y/N responses in FUTON3, creating a new sparse
      evidentiary channel without manual logging.
    - Implement a lightweight inference pass (FUTON3 or FUTON4) to interpret
      these signals for trend detection and early-warning triggers.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Epistemic Rhythm & Salients [💖/弓 ➰/桥]

+ context:
  FUTON0 stabilises your epistemic rhythm: a weekly/multi-weekly cycle of
  review, planning, and salience-tracking that keeps work across all spheres
  coherent while avoiding data fragmentation or over-tracking.

+ if:
  You want to programme yourself the way you programme systems—maintaining
  legible salients across institutional, consulting, technical, reflective,
  and infrastructural spheres with minimal friction.

+ however:
  Without a normalised rhythm, weekly reviews slip; projects drift outside
  the canonical Org structure; and WIP silently grows past safe limits.

+ then:
  Hold a weekly AOB/Ambitions sync; treat Org as the canonical plan/export
  store; mirror all active projects into a minimal FUTON1 substrate; review
  sphere balance weekly; and enforce the WIP cap (>3 active tracks requires
  pausing one). Cron/HUD integration surfaces upcoming reviews (“Weekly review
  in 3 days,” “Monthly audit approaching”) without additional lifelogging.

+ because:
  A stable epistemic rhythm prevents unbounded cognitive load *and makes life
  feel lighter, more joyful, and more tractable*. When salients reappear on
  schedule and WIP remains bounded, drift does not accumulate and affect settles.

+ evidence:
  - Org already represents the canonical project hierarchy (AOB, Ambitions).
  - Weekly AOB/Ambitions sessions are timestamped (Tatami/API or calendar).
  - FUTON1 tags provide >90% work-session closure coverage.
  - Sphere balance and WIP creep can already be inferred from Org + FUTON1.
  - status[ready-pending-final-decisions-and-testing]
  - `futon0/futon0_rhythm.md` (cadence, envelope logging, buildout plan).
  - `futon0/futon0_protocol.md` (open decisions + affect sourcing).
  - `futon0/data/backup_cadence.json`, `futon0/data/backup_report_example.json`,
    `futon0/data/backup_experiments.json`, `futon0/data/affect_markers.json`.
  - `futon0/scripts/futon0/backup/snapshot.clj`,
    `futon0/scripts/futon0/rhythm/envelope.clj`,
    `futon0/scripts/futon0/rhythm/salients.clj`,
    `futon0/scripts/futon0/rhythm/experiments.clj`,
    `futon0/scripts/futon0/rhythm/quarterly.clj`,
    `futon0/scripts/futon0/rhythm/dry_run.clj`.

+ next:
  Consolidate the weekly sync into a fixed time; prune stale Org headings
  monthly; ensure every active project has an Org headline and FUTON1 tag;
  integrate HUD reminders for weekly/monthly cadence; and refine the WIP
  audit to produce actionable “pause/don’t-start” prompts.

  + next-evidence:
    - Cron job generates weekly/mid-week/monthly reminders surfaced in the HUD.
    - FUTON3 salience panel merges Org + FUTON1 metadata into a weekly
      salients snapshot with diff from prior weeks.
    - Quarterly rhythm analysis correlates stable cadence with subjective
      affect measures (energy, focus, lightness) to test the experiential claim.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Core Obligations Contract [👕/业 🎑/书]
@multiarg futon0/prototype2
@title Core Obligations Contract
@audience futon-devs, reflective-agents
@tone analytic-concise
@style flexiarg

+ context:
  FUTON0 must uphold the fundamental constraints that keep the entire stack
  viable: sustained alignment with your current role, movement toward a more
  suitably aligned next role, and protection of basic health baselines. This
  layer also ensures that Prototype 1’s analytics loop remains genuinely useful
  rather than self-perpetuating.

+ if:
  You want your working life to remain healthy and coherent while moving toward
  a better-aligned future role, without sacrificing present obligations or
  drifting into avoidant behaviour.

+ however:
  When attention shifts to higher layers, core obligations can slide into the
  background; health erosion becomes invisible; and epistemic-review routines
  can quietly expand beyond their real value.

+ then:
  Maintain consistently and measurably strong alignment with the current role
  while increasing alignment with a future role; keep health baselines intact;
  and periodically check whether Prototype 1’s analytics loop is delivering
  practical benefit.

+ because:
  Upholding alignment and constraints at the base prevents the entire FUTON
  stack from drifting into incoherence or overload. When obligations, health,
  and review practices stay grounded, forward movement becomes stable and real.

+ evidence:
  - Health baselines visible through Prototype 0 (movement/sleep Y/N).
  - Current-role performance inferred from deliverables, responsiveness,
    and deadline stability.
  - FUTON1 tags showing adequate work-session closure coverage.

+ next:
  Make alignment in the current role more explicit (quick weekly pulse-check);
  establish a small, low-friction trajectory toward the next aligned role;
  and add a brief weekly check on the usefulness of Prototype 1.

  + next-evidence:
    - Cron-backed extraction of role-search traces (calendar items, files,
      emails) to show gentle forward movement.
    - A FUTON3 prompt asking “Did this week’s review help maintain alignment?”
      as a simple measure of analytics-loop value.
    - Correlations between Prototype 0 vitality signals and stable current-role
      performance to validate the alignment hypothesis.


! instantiated-by: Prototype 3 — Ambition 0 Meta-Managed Infrastructure [🙇/叉 💖/稳]

@multiarg futon0/prototype3
@title Ambition 0 — Meta-Managed Infrastructure
@audience futon-devs, reflective-agents
@tone analytic-concise
@style flexiarg

+ context:
  FUTON0 needs an infrastructure layer that not only keeps reality and
  representation aligned, but also increases the system’s capacity for
  alignment over time (Ashby-style requisite variety).

+ if:
  You want your tools to help you notice, raise, and refine signals that
  support increasing alignment in work, health, and direction.

+ however:
  Interfaces drift, signals blur, and representational structures lose fidelity.
  When this happens, the system cannot increase alignment because it cannot
  perceive what is changing or what needs attention.

+ then:
  Treat FUTON1 as the source of truth; use Org as a lightweight interface to
  it; prune dashboards to highlight only rising or fading salients; and run a
  brief reconciliation loop that raises proto-pattern signals for review.

+ because:
  This layer provides the Markov blanket through which alignment can improve.
  Prototype 3 acts as the experience-design prototype of FUTON3: it raises
  signals, surfaces proto-patterns, and increases representational variety,
  while FUTON3 will later formalise this as proof-theoretic salience
  certification.

+ evidence:
  - Org and FUTON1 currently reflect overlapping state that allows detection
    of divergence.
  - Dashboards already reveal what is becoming noisy or inert.
  - Backups and timestamps show which elements are live or stale.

+ next:
  Migrate remaining project state into FUTON1; reduce Org to a thin interface;
  and introduce a weekly “rising/fading signals” pane in FUTON3 to surface
  proto-patterns for reflection.

  + next-evidence:
    - Divergence checks that quantify where representation is lagging reality.
    - Signal-rise/signal-fade detectors for dashboards and headings.
    - FUTON3-generated proto-pattern stubs based on behavioural traces.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 4 — Ambition 1 Hyperreal Enterprises Practice [👎/习 ⌛️/己]
@multiarg futon0/prototype4
@title Ambition 1 — Hyperreal Enterprises Practice
@audience futon-devs, reflective-agents
@tone analytic-concise
@style flexiarg

+ context:
  Hyperreal requires a consulting practice that increases alignment between
  your research, your livelihood, and your long-term direction while generating
  reusable structure rather than bespoke one-offs.

+ if:
  You want each engagement to contribute both to financial stability and to
  the evolution of a sustainable, research-informed independent practice.

+ however:
  Without intentional structure, communication slips; deliverables fragment
  into bespoke artefacts; and the insights generated fail to loop back into
  the system that needs them.

+ then:
  Keep client communication transparent; produce deliverables as reusable,
  documented modules; and extract consulting insights as proto-patterns that
  flow into the Hyperreal backlog and FUTON3’s salience pipeline.

+ because:
  This turns consulting into an alignment engine: work generates reusable
  structure, structure generates higher variety, and higher variety increases
  your future alignment opportunities. Hyperreal becomes evolutionary rather
  than transactional.

+ evidence:
  - Existing consulting deliverables already include modular components.
  - Client communication typically happens through channels that are easily
    timestamped and reviewable.
  - Notes from past engagements show extractable conceptual structure.
  - The VSATLAS work demonstrates a clean example: a reusable flexiarg design
    that extends the client’s system while revealing future service-provision
    revenue streams.

+ next:
  Introduce a lightweight “module template” for new deliverables; add a brief
  reflection step at the end of each engagement; and feed extracted insights
  into FUTON3 for proto-pattern surfacing.

  + next-evidence:
    - Detection of repeated module reuse across engagements.
    - FUTON3-generated proto-patterns based on recurring consulting moves.
    - Evidence of alignment gain: smoother scoping, clearer pricing,
      better-fit clients, and reduced bespoke overhead.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Ambition 2 FUTON–Arxana Stack Stewardship [💖/用 👥/久]

+ context:
  FUTON0 needs a reliable, steadily improving environment for thought. Daily use
  and clear architectural notes keep the FUTON–Arxana stack coherent and usable.

+ if:
  You want FUTON–Arxana to become a dependable workspace for reasoning,
  development, and collaboration.

+ however:
  Skipped daily use weakens the system; undocumented decisions cause drift;
  and premature collaboration introduces scope creep.

+ then:
  Use FUTON1 daily as the live testbed; record architecture reflections as they
  arise; and add collaborators gradually with guardrails that protect scope and
  focus.

+ because:
  Frequent contact and lightweight documentation prevent drift and make the
  system stronger over time. This keeps FUTON–Arxana evolving into a stable,
  coherent environment rather than an abandoned prototype.

+ evidence:
  - FUTON1 already supports daily usage with minimal friction.
  - Architecture notes demonstrate where documentation has prevented drift.
  - Early collaborative experiments (e.g., with Rob) show the value of guardrails.

+ next:
  Stabilise daily usage with light scaffolding; formalise a minimal architecture
  note-taking protocol; and extend Arxana gradually as stable components emerge.

  + next-evidence:
    - Daily FUTON1 usage detectable via timestamps.
    - Architecture notes showing reduced drift or clearer decision points.
    - Arxana prototypes yielding stable nodes or literate fragments.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 6 — Ambition 3 Mojo, Evolving Variety, + Reflective Rhythm [💖/弓 👎/叉]

+ context:
  FUTON0 needs a source of evolving, meaningful variety. Moments of “wondrous
  apprehension”—small encounters with insight, novelty, or strangeness—keep the
  internal model flexible and alive.

+ if:
  You want learning, creativity, and self-understanding to deepen through
  controlled contact with the unknown rather than through routine or ritual.

+ however:
  When these encounters vanish or are postponed indefinitely, patterns ossify,
  curiosity shrinks, and alignment stops increasing.

+ then:
  Invite small, natural opportunities for wondrous apprehension—through ideas,
  conversations, creative acts, or symbolic cues—and metabolise them lightly,
  without turning them into obligations or scheduled rituals.

+ because:
  These brief encounters act as evolutionary impulses: they expand perspective,
  refresh the generative model, and increase adaptive variety. This introduces
  just enough uncertainty to stimulate growth without destabilising the system.

+ evidence:
  - Rhythm experiments such as PAR sessions, RAP sessions, Mojo prompts, and
    card draws have reliably triggered moments of insight without becoming rigid.
  - Creative or relational encounters have historically produced generative
    perspective shifts.
  - Minimal reflection has been sufficient to integrate these signals.

+ next:
  Keep the system open to small shocks of insight; capture only what feels
  naturally significant; and allow FUTON1 or FUTON3 to mark these moments
  lightly when they matter.

  + next-evidence:
    - Occasional tags noting spontaneous insight or perspective shift.
    - Detectable reductions in stagnation or pattern ossification.
    - FUTON3 identification of proto-patterns emerging from these encounters.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 7 — Ambition 4 Role Transition Trajectory [🔦/口 💖/用]
@multiarg futon0/prototype7
@title Ambition 4 — Applied Futon Theory: Co-Evolution With Future Environments
@audience futon-devs, reflective-agents
@tone analytic-concise
@style flexiarg

+ context:
  FUTON0 must support your co-evolution with future environments—roles,
  collaborators, and communities that do not yet fully exist but already exert
  directional influence as futons (real-but-virtual futures).

+ if:
  You want your future working life to emerge through mutual shaping rather
  than reactive job-seeking or inherited scripts.

+ however:
  When futures are treated as fixed targets or when symbols are mistaken for
  the futons they mediate, misalignment grows and trajectories become brittle.

+ then:
  Attend to symbolic signals that reveal possible future environments; explore
  lightly; cultivate relationships that show reciprocal responsiveness; and let
  alignment emerge through ongoing co-evolution rather than forced planning.

+ because:
  Futons influence the present something like photons. The co-evolution of
  present and future echoes Gotama’s dependent causality—agent and future
  conditions arise together in a logical chain—and Alan Moore’s insight that
  all times are immediately accessible in certain states of consciousness. In
  applied futon theory, alignment grows through co-evolution with virtual
  states, not through selection or prediction.

+ evidence:
  - Prior trajectories (Hyperreal, VSATLAS, ORP, band work) emerged through
    reciprocal adaptation, not explicit search.
  - Symbolic cues—patterns, conversations, prototypes—have repeatedly revealed
    access to futures not yet actual.
  - Misaligned contexts typically show low responsiveness early, acting as
    non-resonant futons.

+ next:
  Track signals of futonic resonance or dissonance; maintain light exploratory
  contact with promising environments; and let the trajectory refine itself
  through reciprocal influence rather than pressure.

  + next-evidence:
    - FUTON1 tags capturing futonic moments (resonance, responsiveness,
      momentum).
    - Notes marking when symbolic cues open or close access to future
      attractors.
    - Increasing clarity, lightness, and alignment as co-evolution proceeds.


! instantiated-by: Prototype 8 — Stack Coverage Check [👐/广 👘/判]

+ context:
  Devmaps belong to FUTON3: they are symbolic membranes through which FUTON3
  perceives futons and maintains structural coherence across the stack.
  FUTON0’s role is to support the mindful conditions that allow these symbolic
  structures to appear, evolve, and be refreshed.

+ if:
  You want FUTON3 to notice where the system’s symbolic interfaces to future
  environments are missing, stale, or drifting, before the whole system loses
  alignment.

+ however:
  When narrative, reflection, and wondrous apprehension are weakened, futons
  become harder to perceive; devmaps stagnate; and FUTON3 loses access to
  future-relevant structure.

+ then:
  Maintain a light narrative awareness of the system’s evolving futures; allow
  futons to be apprehended through conversation, reflection, and symbolic
  cues; and let FUTON3 formalise these perceptions into updated devmaps when
  needed.

+ because:
  FUTON0 provides the experiential ground—a mindful openness to futons—
  while FUTON3 handles representational coherence. Without the former, FUTON3
  cannot see; without the latter, FUTON0’s perceptions cannot stabilise.
  Together, they keep the stack aligned across time.

+ evidence:
  - Narrative reflection in this conversation has repeatedly revealed futons
    that were not yet encoded in devmaps.
  - FUTON3 updates gain clarity when experiential insight precedes them.
  - Wondrous apprehension consistently precedes formalisation.

+ next:
  Support FUTON3 by staying attuned to emerging futons; mark futon moments
  lightly when they arise; and trust FUTON3 to handle structural consolidation.

  + next-evidence:
    - FUTON1 entries capturing futon moments.
    - FUTON3 updates that align with experiential insight.
    - Clearer, more resonant devmaps appearing naturally over time.

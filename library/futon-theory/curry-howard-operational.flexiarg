! conclusion:
  Programs are proofs of their specifications. The spec mediates future state
  into present. In futon theory, every operation is a proof that the intended
  state is achievable and achieved.

  + context: The Curry-Howard correspondence reveals that types are theorems
    and programs are proofs. Futon theory operationalizes this: specifications
    are claims about future state, and proof paths demonstrate those claims.

  + OPERATIONAL-INTERPRETATION:
    - Spec: A claim about what the future state should be
    - Program: A proof that the spec can be satisfied
    - Execution: Verification that the proof is valid
    - Result: The spec-mediated future state, now present

  + SPEC-AS-CONTRACT:
    When we write: "Entity X will have property P after operation O"
    We are claiming: There exists a proof path from current state to (X has P)
    The code is that proof. The test verifies the proof.

  + MEDIATING-FUTURE-INTO-PRESENT:
    1. Declare intent (what future state do we want?)
    2. Write spec (formal claim about that state)
    3. Implement (construct the proof)
    4. Verify (check the proof is valid)
    5. Commit (the future state becomes present)

  + TYPE-SYSTEM-ANALOGY:
    - Types = Invariants (what must hold)
    - Functions = Operations (how to maintain invariants)
    - Type checking = Invariant verification (before commit)
    - Runtime = Execution (proof in action)

  + IMPLICATIONS:
    - Untyped code = claims without proof (risky)
    - Type errors = invariant violations (stop-the-line)
    - Passing types = verified claims (commit allowed)

  + RELATIONSHIP-TO-PROOFWORK:
    Proofwork is the labor of constructing proofs. The Curry-Howard principle
    says that labor is meaningful: each proof demonstrates something real
    about the system's state and capabilities.

  + BECAUSE:
    Without this correspondence, code is arbitrary text and specs are wishful
    thinking. With it, code and specs are two views of the same truth. The
    program proves the spec; the spec justifies the program.

! conclusion:
  make storage failures diagnosable in minutes through explicit diagnostics and proof tests

  + context: futon1 repeatedly needed diagnostics and tests to keep storage behavior legible.
  + IF:
    failures lack traceable context (layer, operation, entity, expected vs actual)

  + HOWEVER:
    debugging requires ad hoc spelunking and slow recovery cycles

  + THEN:
    attach explicit diagnostics to all storage errors and prove invariants with targeted tests

  + BECAUSE:
    futon1 fixes show that diagnostics and tests reduced drift and clarified failures

  + STATUS:
    status[proposed]
    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L63]
    evidence[holes/missions/M-futon1a-evidence.md#L33]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define the diagnostic payload shape required on all storage errors.]
    next[Add proof tests for each core invariant and store them in a dedicated suite.]

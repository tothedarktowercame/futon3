! conclusion:
  Recognise that the project tests—rather than presumes—whether dual-layer
  mathematical proofs (formal steps plus validated informal cues) reveal
  reusable proof-pattern fragments that help humans recreate arguments, not just
  verify results.

  + IF:
    Published proofs omit the exploratory hints (“try this substitution”, “argue by symmetry”) that real mathematicians
    rely on, yet those hints, together with expository phrases, suggest—but do
    not prove—the existence of reusable local tactics (reduce to a simpler case,
    argue by symmetry, exploit a known classification).

  + HOWEVER:
    These informal layers live in the textual wraparound of worked solutions and oral scholia; extracting them demands
    transport guarantees (idempotent ingest, per-client supervision, 200 ms status caps, 5 s run limits) plus schema
    validation so that outline-level reasoning can flow into adapters instead of collapsing into vibes.  Moreover, no one
    has shown whether the cues remain stable across problem families or are merely textbook-specific flourishes.  The HDM
    canon already insists on outline-first captures and dialogue-mediated clarification, so F2 must not re-litigate those
    doctrines but feed them evidence.

  + THEN:
    Deliver a controlled pilot that (a) mines open encyclopedias to capture the
    formal register (symbols, named entities, standard relations), (b) mines
    textbooks and solution manuals to extend the informal vocabulary and catch
    any missing formal terms, then (c) captures transport-safe traces of a
    twenty-proof subset where annotators layer progressively detailed
    explanations and validate them through structured seminars across three
    cohorts.  The annotations explicitly record whether each cue appears
    book-specific or generalisable, and the seminar protocol cross-compares
    cohorts so drift is visible.  This three-phase workflow balances breadth
    (via corpus mining) and depth (via human-facing experiments) within six
    months, and every derived dataset, log, and transcript ships with
    reproducibility notes (data provenance, software versions, release
    metadata).
    Router and transport tests (`test/f2/router_test.clj:13`, `test/transport_test.clj:22`) and adapters at
    `src/f2/adapters/mock.clj:1` supply the reliable ingest channel; the new annotation workflow sits on top, grounded in
    `docs/protocol.md:1`.

  + BECAUSE:
    Only by pairing process cues with exposition and validating them through collective review can we tell whether a
    stable mid-level reasoning layer—or proof-pattern fragment—actually exists. If it does, future AI can support human
    learning and help AI solvers check their own work (and let humans audit it);
    if not, the pilot documents the limits with transport-grade evidence.

  + STATUS:
    status[ready]
    evidence[docs/protocol.md:1]
    evidence[test/f2/router_test.clj:13]
    evidence[test/transport_test.clj:22]

  + NEXT:
    next[Assemble a cleared mini-corpus of graduate-level exam solutions with both symbolic steps and informal phrasing; coordinate with data stewards for release notes.]
    next[Extend the dual-language parser so each ingest event carries paired symbolic + informal spans before calling F1 adapters.]
    next[Instrument per-client supervision metrics (through the transport history log) to prove overload alarms and dropped-client handling work under 1k events/min stress.]
    next[Document the pilot outcomes (what surfaced, what failed) in MUSN proof trails so F3 agents can replay the exact scenarios.]

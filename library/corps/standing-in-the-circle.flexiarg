! conclusion: Standing in the Circle
+if: Doctoral researchers are expected to participate in research teams, represent their work, and contribute to shared decisions, yet their reasoning and trade-offs remain invisible to peers.
+however: When a researcher is always positioned as “learner receiving instruction,” collaborators miss the moment when they are ready to act as colleagues.
+then: Provide structured opportunities for them to narrate decisions in a peer-facing format—decision notes, reflective summaries, short presentations of provisional conclusions—so their judgement is legible to the team rather than hidden inside supervisory conversations.
+because: Explicit reasoning creates recognition: supervisors and peers can respond at the appropriate level, collaboration becomes more mature, and the researcher internalises professional discourse norms that move them from student to colleague.

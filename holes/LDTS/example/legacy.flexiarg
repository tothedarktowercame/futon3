! conclusion: talk4real leaves a durable legacy by coupling open, modular infrastructure with graduates who act as agents of collective intelligence. [🌱/友 🔗/互]
  + because: The programme yields software components, data schemas, and design templates alongside researchers fluent in listening, analysis, and redesign.
  + because: Each doctoral project produces a self-contained yet interoperable prototype, so sustainability never depends on a single host institution.
  + illustrates: The Supplement embodies this ethos as a collaboratively authored artefact that is simultaneously document, dataset, and performance.
  + therefore: Graduates seed the method elsewhere while the open infrastructure supports new nodes linking universities, civic organisations, and cultural institutions into an evolving ecosystem.

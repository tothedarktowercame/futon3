! conclusion: The Supplement operationalises talk4real’s REPL by staging a multi-agent workshop that prototypes listening infrastructure, governance, and design tensions in real time. [🗣️/言 🔄/入]
  + because: Facilitators run five segments mapped to Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop with defined roles—facilitator, recorder, reporter, persona agents—to interrogate the brief.
  + because: Persona statements from researchers, doctoral scholars, developer-scholars, supervisors, administrators, and the talk4real team surface strengths, blind spots, and initial stances.
  + instantiated-by: Participants co-design minimal listening captures, consent protocols, tagging vocabularies, and assessment artefacts that treat stories as analyzable yet textured data.
  + therefore: Live debate over anonymisation, governance boards, licensing, and preserving dissent keeps the Print phase accountable to what Read reveals, demonstrating the reflexive loop in action.

! conclusion: Progress Cylinder Assurance
  + context: You want proof of movement well before a deadline rather than a last-minute scramble.
  + IF:
    a task has an explicit SCHEDULED or DEADLINE date and an EFFORT estimate of 1h or more.
  + HOWEVER:
    work tends to bunch after the date, producing false signals of progress and unreliable delivery.
  + THEN:
    require an early effort marker: log at least one work session totaling ≥ 1/3 of EFFORT no later than 3 days before the scheduled/deadline date; if that marker is missing, reschedule or split the task.
  + BECAUSE:
    cylinder-set guarantees are about partial evidence within a bounded prefix; early effort is a compact proof that work is moving through the pipe.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add a check in the agenda view that flags tasks with EFFORT but no early effort marker.]

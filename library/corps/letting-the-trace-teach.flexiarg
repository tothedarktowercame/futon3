! conclusion: Letting the Trace Teach
+if: Doctoral researchers accumulate tacit knowledge but keep it inside informal notes, calls, or unshared materials.
+however: Without public artefacts their emerging expertise stays invisible to collaborators, employers, and interdisciplinary partners.
+then: Encourage the release of small, well-scoped artefacts—annotated examples, brief reflections, walkthroughs, explanatory notes—into venues where relevant peers already circulate.
+because: Public-facing traces signal identity and invite collaboration; they provide low-risk entry points for others to understand, support, or extend the researcher’s work while helping the researcher build confidence as a contributor.

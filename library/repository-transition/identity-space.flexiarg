! conclusion: Our stated values and stakeholder roles form the identity space [🌹/门 👤/社]
              from which all repository behaviours emerge — and the repository
              itself is the institutional surface where this identity becomes visible.

  + because: A research repository is not merely a storage system but the
             institutional surface where research practices are made public,
             accountable, and citable.
    + illustrates: It hosts theses, publications, data, impact evidence,
                   rights metadata, and workflow governance.
    + therefore: The repository reflects — and is shaped by — institutional identity.

  + because: The research lifecycle at OBU spans multiple external systems.
    + instantiated-by: Researchers also use Zenodo, GitHub, Figshare, OSF,
                       Octopus, subject-specific repositories, and custom
                       collaborative tools.
    + illustrates: The repository is not the only home of research, but it is
                   the authoritative institutional expression of it.
    + therefore: Identity must be coherent across both internal and external
                 research surfaces.

  + because: The research ecosystem is shaped by the people who interact with it.
    + instantiated-by: We ARE Depositors, Downloaders, Governance teams,
                       Assessors, Archivists, Students.
    + illustrates: These roles bring different expectations of visibility,
                   compliance, openness, and credit.
    + therefore: Stakeholder identity determines repository behaviours.

  + because: Institutional values establish what "good" research infrastructure
             is assumed to mean.
    + instantiated-by: We BELIEVE in Inclusivity, Confidence, Enterprising
                       Creativity, Connectedness, Generosity of Spirit.
    + illustrates: Aspirations about fairness, accessibility, and collegiality
                   are projected onto repository workflows.
    + therefore: Values shape what stakeholders implicitly expect from the
                 repository.

  + because: Identity and expectations remain tacit unless explicitly mapped.
    + illustrates: Without articulating identity, later misalignments appear as
                   political conflict, technical frustration, or cultural resistance.
    + therefore: Slide 1 must establish the identity inputs before moving to
                 capability outputs.

  + therefore: A viable repository transition must begin by clarifying the role
               of the repository as the institutional surface of research — and
               by mapping the stakeholders and values that shape it.

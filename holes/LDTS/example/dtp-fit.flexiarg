! conclusion: talk4real augments existing doctoral training by embedding meta-learning infrastructure that lets scholars observe, model, and re-engineer the systems they inhabit. [🧠/己 🧱/土]
  + because: Most doctoral programmes teach disciplinary technique but rarely teach how disciplines learn from one another.
  + because: talk4real combines ethnography, computer science, and design so scholars can treat conversation, computation, and intervention as one method.
  + instantiated-by: The Supplement pilot treats conversation as data and prototype as publication, keeping every scholar inside a continuous REPL loop.
  + therefore: The programme operates as a portable connective tissue for other DTPs, enabling cross-cohort self-correction without extra training burden.

@title HDM - Deep Storage -> Active Graph
@sigils [🙅/乃]

! conclusion:
    Use HDM/FUTON6 as an aggregation + activation layer: ingest key fragments from deep storage into a coherent graph, annotate
    them with patterns, proof skeletons, and cross-links, and maintain mappings back to origin sites for provenance.

  + context: You are unifying deep-storage sources into a navigable, provenance-preserving graph.
  + IF:
      Open mathematical repositories ("deep storage") already exist-PlanetMath, arXiv, nLab, wikis, code archives-holding
      enormous value but lacking uniform structure and computational affordances.

  + HOWEVER:
      Treating each repository as its own universe squanders synergies and makes it hard for humans or agents to form a unified
      mental map of mathematics.

  + THEN:
      Use HDM/FUTON6 as an aggregation + activation layer: ingest key fragments from deep storage into a coherent graph, annotate
      them with patterns, proof skeletons, and cross-links, and maintain mappings back to origin sites for provenance.

  + BECAUSE:
      A unified, pattern-indexed graph enables reasoning/learning across boundaries while respecting each project's autonomy and
      identity.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Prototype a deep-storage import pipeline (e.g. PlanetMath MSC26 subset) into FUTON6.]
    next[Record origin metadata and round-trip links for every imported node.]
    next[Apply HDM.L2 motifs (simulation, transparency, outline-first) as design constraints on the pipeline.]
    next[Use this pattern to guide consolidation of old backup drives into active, linked storage.]

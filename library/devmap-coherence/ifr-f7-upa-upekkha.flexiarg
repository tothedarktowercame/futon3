! conclusion:
  audit that FUTON2 viriya metrics, FUTON3 proof trails, FUTON5 ledgers, and FUTON6 math bundles all deliver artifacts consumable by the Hyperreal seed crystal (policies, rituals, accountability loops)

  + context: Ensure all lower futon metrics and evidence are properly tagged to facilitate their use in higher-level structures.
  + IF:
    FUTON7 translates futons 1–6 into Amazon-breaker sphere architectures and Hyperreal-derived seed institutions

  + HOWEVER:
    civic equanimity collapses if exports from lower futons aren’t tagged, interpretable, and usable for Hyperreal Enterprises

  + THEN:
    audit that FUTON2 viriya metrics, FUTON3 proof trails, FUTON5 ledgers, and FUTON6 math bundles all deliver artifacts consumable by the Hyperreal seed crystal (policies, rituals, accountability loops)

  + BECAUSE:
    upa-upekkhā is balance beyond balance—F7 must prove that distributed practice actually shapes civic institutions

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Define a checklist for each lower futon export (metrics, proof trails, ledgers, bundles) and audit quarterly.]
    next[Tag any missing or unusable artifacts with follow-up obligations before Hyperreal integration.]

! conclusion: Treat the loop as healthy when batches stay small, latency stays low, and JSONL output is continuous.
  + context: The realtime loop must stay responsive under bursty chat traffic.
  + IF:
    Batch latency stays under target, dropped_lines stay near zero, and JSONL records are continuous.
  + HOWEVER:
    Short bursts may spike latency or trigger small drops.
  + THEN:
    Keep current settings; focus on integration coverage and matcher quality, not tuning.
  + BECAUSE:
    Stable throughput and low loss indicate the core loop is doing its job.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - evidence: batch latency histogram stays below target (e.g., <200ms).
    - evidence: dropped_lines == 0 for most batches.
    - evidence: JSONL records show steady batch_id increments.
    - evidence-shape: {:latency_ms :int, :dropped_lines :int, :batch_id :int}

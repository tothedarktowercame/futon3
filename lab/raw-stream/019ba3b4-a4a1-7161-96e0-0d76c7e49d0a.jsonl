Use the stack-coherence patterns (e.g. `stack-blocker-detection`) to spot empty dirs or missing artifacts and record `blocked-by[...]` until the prerequisite is done.\n- Watch for repeated sigil pairs in devmaps. The pattern library (e.g. `pattern-differentiation-alarms`) treats duplicates as alarms: either split/merge the underlying patterns, add a more specific devmap-coherence flexiarg, or retire stale clauses. After adjustments, rerun the TF–IDF embedding + sigil matrices so the fake embedding stays meaningful.\n- Contribute new stack-coherence patterns whenever the project needs cross-futon checks (e.g. comparing READMEs vs git logs). These global patterns should inspect hotspots—git history, README timestamps, file trees—to classify each devmap item as “done / blocked / drifting” and help the informal proof engine keep the whole stack honest.\n\n## MUSN stuff\n\nF2 (MUSN) — One-Page Build Brief\n\nScope (thin waist): Transport + routing only.

instantiated-by: Prototype 4b — Intent Embedding & Salience Map [➰/氏 🍍/办]\n  + context: Prototype 4 turns trails into proof-state journals, but it still treats fruits/orbs as cosmetic tags instead of Kolmogorov-style proof types for each constructive step.\n  + if: You want the HUD to say not just “something happened here” but “this was an indicator check, and it was (or wasn’t) aligned with your values” — i.e. to classify `intent → pattern reasoning` as typed proof steps like 🍌→🔵 rather than anonymous log lines.\n  + however: The current trail schema records `:pattern/id` and `:obligation/id` but has no machinery to interpret `intent → pattern reasoning` as a constructive proof step, embed it in fruit/orb space, and ask “what kind of operator was this?” (fruit) and “what meta-property did it exhibit?” (orb) — e.g. “🍌: indicator construction, 🔵: virtue-aligned”.\n  + then: Define a futon3 embedding pipeline that maps each `:trail/intent` plus `:pattern/reasoning` tuple into a low-dimensional vector, projects that vector onto a (fruit, orb) pair understood as (operator-class, meta-property), and computes a `:rule/salience` score from structural, pragmatic, and reflective components; write `:fruit/id`, `:orb/id`, and `:rule/salience` back onto the trail events so Prototype 4 can roll up “which devmap clauses advanced, via which kinds of proof step (e.g. 🍌 indicator definition or check, 🍒 simple inference, 🍊 breakdown into a proof plan, etc.), and how strongly they mattered” per day.\n  + because: In Kolmogorov’s sense, a proof is a construction of an object; here, each trail step is a constructive proof step that builds a pattern-typed object whose canonical form is its (fruit, orb) type. Typing steps like “🍌→🔵” lets you distinguish “this is just a check” from “this is an indicator that actually preserves the virtue invariant,” and salience separates merely valid rules from those that are central to your meta-theory in practice.\n  + design: Implement `futon3.intent-embedding/intent->vec` to encode `:trail/intent` + `:pattern/reasoning` as a vector, `futon3.intent-embedding/vec->fruit+orb` to pick the nearest (fruit, orb) type under a basis where fruits encode proof operator classes (e.g. 🍌 = indicator/check, 🍐 = invariant-preserving step) and orbs encode meta-properties (e.g. 🔵 = value-aligned / virtue-preserving, 🟠 = boundary-discernment); define `futon3.intent-embedding/vec->salience` to combine geometric proximity to an “ideal” direction for each (fruit, orb) type with usage frequency and an optional reflective score. Extend the trail export with `:fruit/id`, `:orb/id`, `:rule/salience`, and add HUD affordances so Tatami can sort, filter, or highlight proof-state entries by their typed role (e.g. all 🍌→🔵 value-aligned checks) instead of just by timestamp.\n  + evidence: Early Cue Embedding tests (`test/futon3/cue_embedding_test.clj`) already show that keyword payloads round-trip through the embedding; hand-labelled fruit/orb assignments in `resources/paramita-grid.edn` provide a gold set for checking whether `vec->fruit+orb` recovers the expected operator/meta-property types on known patterns, including basic Komolgorov relations like “indicator-construction steps that should land in the 🔵 virtue band”.\n  + next: (1) Generalise the existing cue embedding to operate on `:trail/intent` + `:pattern/reasoning` tuples and return (fruit, orb) as proof step types, (2) run a calibration pass over a small set of manually typed patterns to tune the fruit/orb basis and salience weights, ensuring that canonical relations like 🍌→🔵 (“value-aligned indicator checks”) land in the intended region, and (3) wire the enriched trail export into Prototype 4’s rollups so devmap progress can be inspected as “which constructive proof-types actually fired today, how salient they were, and whether the checks that claimed to align with your values really did so in the embedding.”\n\n! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Workday Instrumentation & aob-chatgpt Bridge [💤/每]\n  + context: Within `aob-chatgpt` we already experiment with reflecting on daily actions against devmap obligations.\n  + if: You want FUTON3 to serve as the backend for those reflections.\n  + however: There is no official API for submitting “workday claims,” mapping them to patterns, or receiving verification feedback; roles of “workday participants” and “instrumentation stewards” are undefined.\n  + then: Publish a `workday/submit` endpoint (inputs: timestamp, activity, evidence links), run it through the check DSL + embedding, respond with pattern hits/misses plus follow-up obligations, and name the actors explicitly (participants supply evidence; instrumentation stewards curate dashboards); integrate the same flow into the ChatGPT tooling.\n  + because: This is how empowered action (“joy”) becomes measurable proof progress and how role responsibilities stay legible.\n  + next: Replace the temporary `futon3/logs/workday.edn` queue with a Futon1 persistence call (`workday->graph`) and add HTTP affordances + dashboards so instrumentation stewards can audit submissions without tailing logs.\n  + evidence: Workday intake lives in `src/futon3/workday.clj` with coverage in `test/transport_test.clj` (workday submission) and README sections describing the API.\n\n!

But these exist as separate artifacts: code, docs, and schemas that humans must correlate.\n  + if: You want the system to describe itself in a way that agents can query, and for that description to stay synchronized with implementation.\n  + however: No machine-readable manifest exists where components are first-class entities in the hypergraph. Patterns describe design structures but not system capabilities.\n  + then: Unify documentation and APIs into a machine-readable manifest where stack components are first-class entities in Futon1. Patterns describe not just design structures but system capabilities—what the message bus can do, what functions the Emacs interface exposes, what invariants each layer enforces. Enable agents to query the system about its own capabilities, and self-verify that the running system matches its declared structure.\n  + because: This closes the reflexivity loop: a semantic network that includes a model of itself. FUTON3's pattern checker already validates its own devmap; extending this to describe the full stack enables ongoing self-documentation as the system extends. The machinery from F5 (patterns → schema → code) applies reflexively: the stack itself becomes a domain.\n  + evidence:\n    - `futon4/docs/evidence/rc-1.1-evidence.edn` seeds a machine-readable claim map for Futon0–Futon4.\n  + next:\n    - Expand the evidence map into a manifest schema (components, interfaces, invariants) and ingest it into Futon1 for queryable self-description.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

outputs: status, missing fields, derived tasks), enforce schema validation, and log every check as a proof state record.\n70:  + because: Turning patterns into executable checks is what makes FUTON3 “flexiformal” rather than just narrative.\n79:  + if: You want every check, dismissal, and new pattern idea to leave an auditable trail.\n81:  + then: Extend the trail schema with `:pattern/id`, `:obligation/id`, `:action/tags`, and `:delta/joy`, add rollups that show which devmap clauses advanced per day, and expose a `/musn/trails/proof` export for futon4 archives.\n83:  + design: The Tatami HUD cue-reflection pattern mirrors every FROM-CHATGPT entry back through `/musn/cues` so fruits/orbs in the HUD match the transport’s cue embedding (`contrib/aob-chatgpt.el:1503`, `src/f2/ui.clj:97`, `src/futon3/cue_embedding.clj:214`).\n90:  + if: You want the HUD to say not just “something happened here” but “this was an indicator check, and it was (or wasn’t) aligned with your values” — i.e. to classify `intent → pattern reasoning` as typed proof steps like 🍌→🔵 rather than anonymous log lines.\n91:  + however: The current trail schema records `:pattern/id` and `:obligation/id` but has no machinery to interpret `intent → pattern reasoning` as a constructive proof step, embed it in fruit/orb space, and ask “what kind of operator was this?” (fruit) and “what meta-property did it exhibit?” (orb) — e.g. “🍌: indicator construction, 🔵: virtue-aligned”.\n92:  + then: Define a futon3 embedding pipeline that maps each `:trail/intent` plus `:pattern/reasoning` tuple into a low-dimensional vector, projects that vector onto a (fruit, orb) pair understood as (operator-class, meta-property), and computes a `:rule/salience` score from structural, pragmatic, and reflective components; write `:fruit/id`, `:orb/id`, and `:rule/salience` back onto the trail events so Prototype 4 can roll up “which devmap clauses advanced, via which kinds of proof step (e.g. 🍌 indicator definition or check, 🍒 simple inference, 🍊 breakdown into a proof plan, etc.), and how strongly they mattered” per day.\n93:  + because: In Kolmogorov’s sense, a proof is a construction of an object; here, each trail step is a constructive proof step that builds a pattern-typed object whose canonical form is its (fruit, orb) type. Typing steps like “🍌→🔵” lets you distinguish “this is just a check” from “this is an indicator that actually preserves the virtue invariant,” and salience separates merely valid rules from those that are central to your meta-theory in practice.\n94:  + design: Implement `futon3.intent-embedding/intent->vec` to encode `:trail/intent` + `:pattern/reasoning` as a vector, `futon3.intent-embedding/vec->fruit+orb` to pick the nearest (fruit, orb) type under a basis where fruits encode proof operator classes (e.g. 🍌 = indicator/check, 🍐 = invariant-preserving step) and orbs encode meta-properties (e.g. 🔵 = value-aligned / virtue-preserving, 🟠 = boundary-discernment); define `futon3.intent-embedding/vec->salience` to combine geometric proximity to an “ideal” direction for each (fruit, orb) type with usage frequency and an optional reflective score. Extend the trail export with `:fruit/id`, `:orb/id`, `:rule/salience`, and add HUD affordances so Tatami can sort, filter, or highlight proof-state entries by their typed role (e.g. all 🍌→🔵 value-aligned checks) instead of just by timestamp.\n95:  + evidence: Early Cue Embedding tests (`test/futon3/cue_embedding_test.clj`) already show that keyword payloads round-trip through the embedding; hand-labelled fruit/orb assignments in `resources/paramita-grid.edn` provide a gold set for checking whether `vec->fruit+orb` recovers the expected operator/meta-property types on known patterns, including basic Komolgorov relations like “indicator-construction steps that should land in the 🔵 virtue band”.\n96:  + next: (1) Generalise the existing cue embedding to operate on `:trail/intent` + `:pattern/reasoning` tuples and return (fruit, orb) as proof step types, (2) run a calibration pass over a small set of manually typed patterns to tune the fruit/orb basis and salience weights, ensuring that canonical relations like 🍌→🔵 (“value-aligned indicator checks”) land in the intended region, and (3) wire the enriched trail export into Prototype 4’s rollups so devmap progress can be inspected as “which constructive proof-types actually fired today, how salient they were, and whether the checks that claimed to align with your values really did so in the embedding.”\n101:  + however: There is no official API for submitting “workday claims,” mapping them to patterns, or receiving verification feedback; roles of “workday participants” and “instrumentation stewards” are undefined.\n102:  + then: Publish a `workday/submit` endpoint (inputs: timestamp, activity, evidence links), run it through the check DSL + embedding, respond with pattern hits/misses plus follow-up obligations, and name the actors explicitly (participants supply evidence; instrumentation stewards curate dashboards); integrate the same flow into the ChatGPT tooling.\n108:  + context: New patterns emerge from trails and devmap edits, but the capture is currently manual in futon4.\n109:  + if: You want FUTON3 to draft candidate patterns/flexiargs from accumulated proof states.\n133:  + then: Package a \"Flexiformal Training Ground\" release: updated README, tutorials referencing `t4r/` training patterns, sample check sessions, and a minimal simulator that feeds FUTON6's Hyperreal entries; name facilitators (FUTON3 maintainers) and consumers (FUTON6 trainees), and publish readiness criteria (tutorials complete, simulator recorded, onboarding docs updated) before tagging the release.\n142:  + because: This closes the reflexivity loop: a semantic network that includes a model of itself.

instantiated-by: Prototype 3 — Applicability Engine & Check DSL [🌽/末 🎑/判]\n  + context: We want FUTON3 to answer “can this pattern apply?” and “what new obligations arise?”\n  + if: You want a declarative DSL (possibly REPL-safe) for posing check contexts and receiving structured verdicts (applies / blocked / missing evidence).\n  + however: Checks today are conversational heuristics in aob-chatgpt or handwritten flexiargs.\n  + then: Define a `check!` API (inputs: pattern ID, context EDN, evidence refs; outputs: status, missing fields, derived tasks), enforce schema validation, and log every check as a proof state record.\n  + because: Turning patterns into executable checks is what makes FUTON3 “flexiformal” rather than just narrative.\n  + next: Ship the Futon1/Futon2 adapters so `futon3/logs/checks.edn` entries replicate into graph + viriya stores instead of living only in local logs, and expose `/musn/check` over HTTP once the transport contract is frozen.\n  + evidence: `src/futon3/checks.clj`, `src/f2/router.clj`, `src/f2/transport.clj`\n    (Futon1 bridge wiring), `src/futon3/futon1_bridge.clj`, and\n    `test/transport_test.clj` (workday/check forwarding cases) exercise the DSL\n    end-to-end.\n\n! instantiated-by: Prototype 4 — Trail & Proof-State Journal [➰/双]\n  + context: Wisdom trails already exist for tracing exploration, but now they must document proof obligations and how work sessions discharged them.\n  + if: You want every check, dismissal, and new pattern idea to leave an auditable trail.\n  + however: Trails are still general-purpose exploration logs, not proof-state journals.\n  + then: Extend the trail schema with `:pattern/id`, `:obligation/id`, `:action/tags`, and `:delta/joy`, add rollups that show which devmap clauses advanced per day, and expose a `/musn/trails/proof` export for futon4 archives.\n  + because: The whole point is to measure how daily practice advances the devmaps.\n  + design: The Tatami HUD cue-reflection pattern mirrors every FROM-CHATGPT entry back through `/musn/cues` so fruits/orbs in the HUD match the transport’s cue embedding (`contrib/aob-chatgpt.el:1503`, `src/f2/ui.clj:97`, `src/futon3/cue_embedding.clj:214`).\n  + evidence: `resources/tatami-events.edn` captures live tatami sessions, `resources/tatami-context.edn` logs every FROM-CHATGPT-EDN HUD payload, and the cue embedding tests (`test/futon3/cue_embedding_test.clj`) prove keyword/intentionally-null payloads round-trip.\n  + blocked-by [:trail/persistence :cue-validation]\n  + next: (1) persist cue annotations into the trail export so Prototype 4 records which fruits/orbs were actually computed, and (2) add proof artifacts (HUD screenshots or `/musn/cues` transcripts) that demonstrate the cues signal real changes instead of static defaults before declaring the prototype stable.\n\n! instantiated-by: Prototype 4b — Intent Embedding & Salience Map [➰/氏 🍍/办]\n  + context: Prototype 4 turns trails into proof-state journals, but it still treats fruits/orbs as cosmetic tags instead of Kolmogorov-style proof types for each constructive step.\n  + if: You want the HUD to say not just “something happened here” but “this was an indicator check, and it was (or wasn’t) aligned with your values” — i.e. to classify `intent → pattern reasoning` as typed proof steps like 🍌→🔵 rather than anonymous log lines.\n  + however: The current trail schema records `:pattern/id` and `:obligation/id` but has no machinery to interpret `intent → pattern reasoning` as a constructive proof step, embed it in fruit/orb space, and ask “what kind of operator was this?” (fruit) and “what meta-property did it exhibit?” (orb) — e.g. “🍌: indicator construction, 🔵: virtue-aligned”.\n  + then: Define a futon3 embedding pipeline that maps each `:trail/intent` plus `:pattern/reasoning` tuple into a low-dimensional vector, projects that vector onto a (fruit, orb) pair understood as (operator-class, meta-property), and computes a `:rule/salience` score from structural, pragmatic, and reflective components; write `:fruit/id`, `:orb/id`, and `:rule/salience` back onto the trail events so Prototype 4 can roll up “which devmap clauses advanced, via which kinds of proof step (e.g. 🍌 indicator definition or check, 🍒 simple inference, 🍊 breakdown into a proof plan, etc.), and how strongly they mattered” per day.\n  + because: In Kolmogorov’s sense, a proof is a construction of an object; here, each trail step is a constructive proof step that builds a pattern-typed object whose canonical form is its (fruit, orb) type. Typing steps like “🍌→🔵” lets you distinguish “this is just a check” from “this is an indicator that actually preserves the virtue invariant,” and salience separates merely valid rules from those that are central to your meta-theory in practice.\n  + design: Implement `futon3.intent-embedding/intent->vec` to encode `:trail/intent` + `:pattern/reasoning` as a vector, `futon3.intent-embedding/vec->fruit+orb` to pick the nearest (fruit, orb) type under a basis where fruits encode proof operator classes (e.g. 🍌 = indicator/check, 🍐 = invariant-preserving step) and orbs encode meta-properties (e.g. 🔵 = value-aligned / virtue-preserving, 🟠 = boundary-discernment); define `futon3.intent-embedding/vec->salience` to combine geometric proximity to an “ideal” direction for each (fruit, orb) type with usage frequency and an optional reflective score. Extend the trail export with `:fruit/id`, `:orb/id`, `:rule/salience`, and add HUD affordances so Tatami can sort, filter, or highlight proof-state entries by their typed role (e.g. all 🍌→🔵 value-aligned checks) instead of just by timestamp.\n  + evidence: Early Cue Embedding tests (`test/futon3/cue_embedding_test.clj`) already show that keyword payloads round-trip through the embedding; hand-labelled fruit/orb assignments in `resources/paramita-grid.edn` provide a gold set for checking whether `vec->fruit+orb` recovers the expected operator/meta-property types on known patterns, including basic Komolgorov relations like “indicator-construction steps that should land in the 🔵 virtue band”.\n  + next: (1) Generalise the existing cue embedding to operate on `:trail/intent` + `:pattern/reasoning` tuples and return (fruit, orb) as proof step types, (2) run a calibration pass over a small set of manually typed patterns to tune the fruit/orb basis and salience weights, ensuring that canonical relations like 🍌→🔵 (“value-aligned indicator checks”) land in the intended region, and (3) wire the enriched trail export into Prototype 4’s rollups so devmap progress can be inspected as “which constructive proof-types actually fired today, how salient they were, and whether the checks that claimed to align with your values really did so in the embedding.”\n\n! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Workday Instrumentation & aob-chatgpt Bridge [💤/每]\n  + context: Within `aob-chatgpt` we already experiment with reflecting on daily actions against devmap obligations.\n  + if: You want FUTON3 to serve as the backend for those reflections.\n  + however: There is no official API for submitting “workday claims,” mapping them to patterns, or receiving verification feedback; roles of “workday participants” and “instrumentation stewards” are undefined.\n  + then: Publish a `workday/submit` endpoint (inputs: timestamp, activity, evidence links), run it through the check DSL + embedding, respond with pattern hits/misses plus follow-up obligations, and name the actors explicitly (participants supply evidence; instrumentation stewards curate dashboards); integrate the same flow into the ChatGPT tooling.\n  + because: This is how empowered action (“joy”) becomes measurable proof progress and how role responsibilities stay legible.\n  + next: Replace the temporary `futon3/logs/workday.edn` queue with a Futon1 persistence call (`workday->graph`) and add HTTP affordances + dashboards so instrumentation stewards can audit submissions without tailing logs.\n  + evidence: Workday intake lives in `src/futon3/workday.clj` with coverage in `test/transport_test.clj` (workday submission) and README sections describing the API.\n\n! instantiated-by: Prototype 6 — Pattern Creation Workbench [👍/已]\n  + context: New patterns emerge from trails and devmap edits, but the capture is currently manual in futon4.\n  + if: You want FUTON3 to draft candidate patterns/flexiargs from accumulated proof states.\n  + however: Manual backlog in FUTON4 creates tension; there is no readiness window for when drafts are “hand-off ready.”\n  + then: Build a summariser that clusters trails, extracts hooks, and emits draft flexiarg blocks (IF/HOWEVER/THEN/BECAUSE) tagged with suggested pāramitā, ready for futon4 editors, and declare readiness criteria (e.g., at least N supporting checks + steward review) so handoffs are predictable.\n  + because: FUTON3 should not just consume the library; it should propose expansions grounded in lived work while signalling when drafts can be trusted.\n\n! instantiated-by: Prototype 7 — Joy-as-Empowered-Action Metrics [⌛️/力 ⚡️/每]\n  + context: Joy here = Spinozan increase in power to act, evidenced by commitments you can now keep.\n  + if: You want metrics that show whether checks are empowering or draining.\n  + however: Current “joy metrics” counted UI friction; they did not measure proofs discharged or obligations unblocked.\n  + then: Track `time-to-proof`, `obligations-cleared`, `follow-on commitments`, and `viriya linkages` per session, and visualise them alongside subjective notes.\n  + because: Empowered action is the KPI for this futon.\n\n! instantiated-by: Prototype 8 — futon2/futon1 Proof Hooks [⚡️/二 👎/已]\n  + context: FUTON3 already generates proof states; FUTON1 (graph) and FUTON2 (energy) need those proofs as fuel.\n  + if: You want every accepted check to become a graph relation and a viriya delta without manual glue.\n  + however: today the exports are bespoke Clerk notebooks or one-off scripts.\n  + then: standardise two adapters—`proof->graph` (materialise relations with provenance) and `proof->energy` (emit activation deltas for futon2 dashboards)—and lock them with fixtures + schemas.\n  + because: proofs only matter when other futons can act on them automatically.\n  + next: Wire the Tatami event log into FUTON1 (per `futon3/tatami_store.clj` TODO) so session events flow into graph-memory before we expose the adapters.\n\n! instantiated-by: Prototype 9 — Proof Training Ground (\"Flexiformal Agent Sandbox\") [🚢/氏 🏃/未]\n  + context: FUTON3 needs a reproducible training ground where humans and agents can practice flexiformal checks before contributing to FUTON6.\n  + if: You want collaborators (including FUTON6 math stewards) to experience the proof workflow hands-on.\n  + however: README/docs still emphasise ants and MUD metaphors and do not ship a simulator/tutorial bundle; roles (training facilitators vs. FUTON6 learners) and release readiness are not declared.\n  + then: Package a \"Flexiformal Training Ground\" release: updated README, tutorials referencing `t4r/` training patterns, sample check sessions, and a minimal simulator that feeds FUTON6's Hyperreal entries; name facilitators (FUTON3 maintainers) and consumers (FUTON6 trainees), and publish readiness criteria (tutorials complete, simulator recorded, onboarding docs updated) before tagging the release.\n  + because: Storytelling plus an explicit training ground turns FUTON3 into a reproducible service that upstream layers (FUTON6, FUTON7) can consume and steward.\n  + next: Aggregate Tatami session proof events into `proof-chain.edn` (per `tatami_store.clj` TODO) so the training ground exports persistent transcripts.\n\n! instantiated-by: Prototype 10 — System Self-Description & Machine-Readable Manifest [🔃/本 📋/系统]\n  + context: The stack currently has documentation and APIs at various layers—Futon1's storage API with checked invariants, Emacs Lisp functions callable via emacsclient, HTTP/WebSocket endpoints in Futon3. But these exist as separate artifacts: code, docs, and schemas that humans must correlate.\n  + if: You want the system to describe itself in a way that agents can query, and for that description to stay synchronized with implementation.\n  + however: No machine-readable manifest exists where components are first-class entities in the hypergraph. Patterns describe design structures but not system capabilities.\n  + then: Unify documentation and APIs into a machine-readable manifest where stack components are first-class entities in Futon1. Patterns describe not just design structures but system capabilities—what the message bus can do, what functions the Emacs interface exposes, what invariants each layer enforces. Enable agents to query the system about its own capabilities, and self-verify that the running system matches its declared structure.\n  + because: This closes the reflexivity loop: a semantic network that includes a model of itself. FUTON3's pattern checker already validates its own devmap; extending this to describe the full stack enables ongoing self-documentation as the system extends. The machinery from F5 (patterns → schema → code) applies reflexively: the stack itself becomes a domain.\n  + evidence:\n    - `futon4/docs/evidence/rc-1.1-evidence.edn` seeds a machine-readable claim map for Futon0–Futon4.\n  + next:\n    - Expand the evidence map into a manifest schema (components, interfaces, invariants) and ingest it into Futon1 for queryable self-description.\n","exit_code":0,"status":"completed"}}

FUTON5 requires not only descriptions of improvisation but *operators* that act on F4/F5 patterns. The target is ~256 core meta-patterns, grounded computationally in the 256 elementary cellular automata—each CA treated as a control feature at the meta level.\nholes/futon5.devmap:24:  + however: Current improvisation notes, CT riffs, musical examples, and MetaCA sketches exist as fragments, not as typed operators that can act on pattern-graphs.

The formalism applies reflexively: the stack itself becomes a domain, enabling ongoing self-documentation as the system extends.\nholes/futon5.devmap:34:  + context: FUTON4 already uses a 256-sigil alphabet to index symbolic states and pattern traces. FUTON5 requires these sigils to index *meta-patterns*—operators that transform F4/F5 pattern-graphs.\nholes/futon5.devmap:36:  + however: Sigils currently tag patterns descriptively but lack operational semantics; no mapping exists between a sigil and the transformation it performs on a pattern-graph.\nholes/futon5.devmap:38:       • input type (pattern, riff, argument, or multi-node diagram),  \nholes/futon5.devmap:39:       • output type (new pattern-graph, mutated pattern, or practice directive),  \nholes/futon5.devmap:45:  + because: Without a sigil-indexed transformation alphabet, FUTON5 lacks executable concentration mechanics. With it, sigils become active operators—an RNA engine capable of transforming DNA-patterns from FUTON4 into living, improvisable forms.\nholes/futon5.devmap:52:  + then: Establish a “Concentration Engine” protocol with 3–5 stable practice grooves (bass technique, CT reading, coding drills, MetaCA tinkering), ensure each groove has low activation energy and clear termination points, and track them in FUTON5 as patterns rather than habits.\nholes/futon5.devmap:56:  + context: Flexiarg formalises arguments (F6) while FUTON5 formalises patterns.\nholes/futon5.devmap:57:  + if: You want a domain-agnostic, cross-modal pattern language scaffold that sits between Arxana and the argumentarium.\nholes/futon5.devmap:58:  + however: Existing patterns are scattered across papers (P4P, P4D, P4NG) and are not harmonised.\nholes/futon5.devmap:59:  + then: Define a minimal F5 pattern schema (@pattern-id, IF/HOWEVER/THEN/BECAUSE where useful, examples across music/code/CT/life, invariants/failure modes, “improvisation affordances”) and refactor 6–12 core patterns into that schema.\nholes/futon5.devmap:60:  + because: FUTON5 needs a pattern substrate that can plug directly into FUTON6’s argument logic.\nholes/futon5.devmap:66:  + then: Reframe MetaCA as an F5 conceptual engine where local rules equal riffs/CT arrows/pattern transforms, the global rule embodies AIF, edge-of-chaos represents productive creativity, collapse modes name burnout/ego/overcontrol, and capture this in one short essay inside the F5 devmap.\nholes/futon5.devmap:73:  + then: Define a simple Nonstarter Ledger inside F5 that tracks “value given” (hours, riffs, patterns released), “value received” (collaboration, uplift, resonance), enforces a “no-ask posture” protocol, encodes reciprocity loops based on pattern contribution rather than money, and distinguishes RESCUE requests from COLLABORATION requests.\nholes/futon5.devmap:87:  + then: Define three conduction modes—F4→F5 (prototype → practice, what to work on today), F5→F6 (practice → argument, what becomes a formal insight), F6→F5 (argument → pattern, what needs to be embodied)—and document these flows as short “transmission patterns.”\nholes/futon5.devmap:91:  + context: The meta-pattern formalism claims that patterns developed in one domain can transfer to another. This claim must be validated, not just asserted.\nholes/futon5.devmap:93:  + however: No concrete demonstration yet shows a pattern developed for (e.g.) ant simulation actually working when applied to cellular automata control, music, or another domain.\nholes/futon5.devmap:94:  + then: Select 2-3 patterns from the core set, develop them fully in one domain (e.g., ants or MetaCA), then apply them to a different domain (e.g., musical improvisation or crowdfunding) and document whether they work, fail, or require adaptation.

write `:fruit/id`, `:orb/id`, and `:rule/salience` back onto the trail events so Prototype 4 can roll up “which devmap clauses advanced, via which kinds of proof step (e.g. 🍌 indicator definition or check, 🍒 simple inference, 🍊 breakdown into a proof plan, etc.), and how strongly they mattered” per day.\nholes/futon3.devmap:93:  + because: In Kolmogorov’s sense, a proof is a construction of an object; here, each trail step is a constructive proof step that builds a pattern-typed object whose canonical form is its (fruit, orb) type. Typing steps like “🍌→🔵” lets you distinguish “this is just a check” from “this is an indicator that actually preserves the virtue invariant,” and salience separates merely valid rules from those that are central to your meta-theory in practice.\nholes/futon3.devmap:94:  + design: Implement `futon3.intent-embedding/intent->vec` to encode `:trail/intent` + `:pattern/reasoning` as a vector, `futon3.intent-embedding/vec->fruit+orb` to pick the nearest (fruit, orb) type under a basis where fruits encode proof operator classes (e.g. 🍌 = indicator/check, 🍐 = invariant-preserving step) and orbs encode meta-properties (e.g. 🔵 = value-aligned / virtue-preserving, 🟠 = boundary-discernment); define `futon3.intent-embedding/vec->salience` to combine geometric proximity to an “ideal” direction for each (fruit, orb) type with usage frequency and an optional reflective score. Extend the trail export with `:fruit/id`, `:orb/id`, `:rule/salience`, and add HUD affordances so Tatami can sort, filter, or highlight proof-state entries by their typed role (e.g. all 🍌→🔵 value-aligned checks) instead of just by timestamp.\nholes/futon3.devmap:95:  + evidence: Early Cue Embedding tests (`test/futon3/cue_embedding_test.clj`) already show that keyword payloads round-trip through the embedding; hand-labelled fruit/orb assignments in `resources/paramita-grid.edn` provide a gold set for checking whether `vec->fruit+orb` recovers the expected operator/meta-property types on known patterns, including basic Komolgorov relations like “indicator-construction steps that should land in the 🔵 virtue band”.\nholes/futon3.devmap:96:  + next: (1) Generalise the existing cue embedding to operate on `:trail/intent` + `:pattern/reasoning` tuples and return (fruit, orb) as proof step types, (2) run a calibration pass over a small set of manually typed patterns to tune the fruit/orb basis and salience weights, ensuring that canonical relations like 🍌→🔵 (“value-aligned indicator checks”) land in the intended region, and (3) wire the enriched trail export into Prototype 4’s rollups so devmap progress can be inspected as “which constructive proof-types actually fired today, how salient they were, and whether the checks that claimed to align with your values really did so in the embedding.”\nholes/futon3.devmap:101:  + however: There is no official API for submitting “workday claims,” mapping them to patterns, or receiving verification feedback; roles of “workday participants” and “instrumentation stewards” are undefined.\nholes/futon3.devmap:102:  + then: Publish a `workday/submit` endpoint (inputs: timestamp, activity, evidence links), run it through the check DSL + embedding, respond with pattern hits/misses plus follow-up obligations, and name the actors explicitly (participants supply evidence; instrumentation stewards curate dashboards); integrate the same flow into the ChatGPT tooling.\nholes/futon3.devmap:108:  + context: New patterns emerge from trails and devmap edits, but the capture is currently manual in futon4.\nholes/futon3.devmap:109:  + if: You want FUTON3 to draft candidate patterns/flexiargs from accumulated proof states.\nholes/futon3.devmap:133:  + then: Package a \"Flexiformal Training Ground\" release: updated README, tutorials referencing `t4r/` training patterns, sample check sessions, and a minimal simulator that feeds FUTON6's Hyperreal entries; name facilitators (FUTON3 maintainers) and consumers (FUTON6 trainees), and publish readiness criteria (tutorials complete, simulator recorded, onboarding docs updated) before tagging the release.\nholes/futon3.devmap:142:  + because: This closes the reflexivity loop: a semantic network that includes a model of itself. FUTON3's pattern checker already validates its own devmap; extending this to describe the full stack enables ongoing self-documentation as the system extends. The machinery from F5 (patterns → schema → code) applies reflexively: the stack itself becomes a domain.\nholes/futon7.devmap:9:@IFR: FUTON7 is the accountability and assurance layer: infrastructure for tracking costs, benefits, and relationships across supply chains, companies, and spheres of engagement.

Just as free software proved to have benefits its founders didn't anticipate, transparent and accountable approaches to commerce and governance may prove beneficial in ways we can't yet predict.

{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_2","type":"reasoning","text":"**Assessing sigil pair collisions and release impact**\n\nI’m reviewing the collision log showing 5 uses of the 🚴/了 pair across the t4r suite to decide if a new pair is needed before the training ground release. Since these collisions are confined within the t4r corpus and don't affect other projects like futon, it seems acceptable to keep the pair as is without change. I’ll provide a concise conclusion referencing the specific files and lines for transparency and suggest monitoring usage going forward."}}
{"type":"item.completed","item":{"id":"item_3","type":"agent_message","text":"t4r uses 🚴/了 across five adjacent clauses (exec-summary, legacy, rationale, supplement, value), so the collision report (`docs/sigil-collisions.md:3-18`) only flags an internal cluster; no futon devmap entries share the pair yet. Given the Supplement clause is already anchored by 👄/口 🔁/衡 (`library/t4r/supplement.flexiarg:2-20`) and we just reference that pattern from Prototype 9 without changing its sigils, there’s no staging risk—keeping 🚴/了 maintains the talk4real bundle’s cohesion while the training-ground release simply cites the pattern rather than inheriting its pair. No change needed right now; just re-run `clojure -M:sigils` after any future t4r edits to ensure the collision report stays current. Potential next step, if the t4r set later feeds multiple futons, is to reserve a joy/governance sigil specifically for cross-futon training artefacts to avoid expanding the 🚴/了 cluster beyond that self-contained suite."}}

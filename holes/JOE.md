# FUTON Developer Contract (rev. 23 Nov 2025)

This document is the live contract for anyone (currently just me) touching the
FUTON stack via CLI. It encodes the flexiformal contributor rules described in
`AGENTS.md` and binds them to the merged FUTON0 devmap obligations
(`futon0.devmap`).

## 1. Scope & Intent

- Every change, log entry, or decision must cite the Prototype clause it tries
  to satisfy (emoji/hanzi welcomed) and the evidence channel used (Org, FUTON1,
  PARAMITA, ledger).
- Prototype 0 must remain satisfied before progressing any higher prototype.
  Prototype pointers: `futon0.devmap:9-77`, futon1–futon7 Prototype 0 clauses.
- Contributions default to “unchecked” until evidence is written; this contract
  is the checklist that flips those states.

## 2. Proof Workflow (CLI Ritual)

1. **Load clauses** – read relevant devmap blocks; Prototype 8 must confirm all
   devmaps exist before working (weekly 🍍 audit entry).
2. **State intent** – at session start, note in Org or PARAMITA which prototype
   goals are targeted and what constitutes evidence.
3. **Do the work** – keep FUTON1 running; for each notable action or skipped
   action, log via FUTON0 clock with fruit + paramitā tag (`futon0.devmap:9-14`).
4. **Convolve** – map evidence to clauses (`AGENTS.md` workflow) and update this
   contract’s checklist.
5. **Emit proof** – summarize session proof steps (devmap refs + evidence paths)
   and archive deltas in Org / PARAMITA.

## 3. Evidence Requirements

| Artefact          | Mandate                                                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FUTON0 clock log  | Every action/skip carries ≥1 fruit + ≥1 paramitā (Prototype 0).            |
| FUTON1 log        | Each work session ends with a FUTON1-tagged entry and architecture note    |
| Org (`aob.org`)   | Weekly AOB/WIP sync + dashboard adjustments recorded (Prototype 1 & 3).    |
| PARAMITA/PAR      | Tactic-state narrative for reflection + proof summaries.                   |
| External proof    | Job wins, outreach, creative output, coaching sessions captured as 🍐 logs |

Evidence is incomplete without linking emoji/hanzi back to devmap clauses; use
`AGENTS.md` Rosetta when tagging.

## 4. Safety & Flexiformal Guardrails

- REPL/CLI experiments run under SAFE defaults unless admin token + rationale
  is logged.
- New scripts or agent behaviours require a short flexiarg note describing
  their intent, prototype target, and rollback plan.
- Missing evidence must be turned into explicit TODOs before ending a session.

## 5. Current Proof Goals (carry-over from last convolution)

These remain open until evidence is logged. Tick only after updating the
relevant artefact and citing it in PARAMITA/Org.

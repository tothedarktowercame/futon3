! conclusion: Yield to incoming force by creating vacuum; adhere to the movement rather than opposing it.
  + context: An agent faces strong incoming energy (demands, assertions, pressure) that cannot be simply warded off.
  + IF:
    Direct resistance would be costly or futile, and the incoming force has momentum that can be redirected.
  + HOWEVER:
    Yielding without adherence is collapse. The agent must stay connected to the incoming energy while redirecting it—creating vacuum, not void.
  + THEN:
    Don't resist the movement; accompany it. Lǚ is soft, receptive, yīn energy. It creates space by moving with the force while subtly changing its direction. The redirect results in adhering to the source—you stay connected, learning its shape and intention as you guide it past your center.
  + BECAUSE:
    Risks (HOWEVER fields) are not obstacles to eliminate but forces to redirect. Acknowledging a risk means adhering to it—understanding its shape—not fighting it. The vacuum created by yielding destabilizes the source more than resistance would.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - When facing strong assertions, accompany them before redirecting.
    - Create space by moving, not by blocking.
    - Stay connected (adhere) to understand the force's true direction.

    - agent/state-is-hypothesis (adapting to incoming information)

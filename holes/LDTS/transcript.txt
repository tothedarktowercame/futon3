ChatGPT(gpt-5/General)> You are writing the section "Executive Summary" for:

ID: t4r/exec-summary-tree
Audience: research funders, doctoral-training consortia, university R&I leads
Tone: analytic-visionary
Length: 200–250 words

Here is the required argument backbone:

1. CONCLUSION: talk4real reimagines doctoral training as a shared experimental learning infrastructure that continually refines itself through reflexive, collective practice.
2. PREMISE (because): Most doctoral programmes operate within disciplinary or thematic silos.
3. PREMISE (therefore): These silos engage minimally with learning beyond their boundaries and contribute little to improving practice at system level.
4. PREMISE (because): Collective-intelligence frameworks can capture feedback between researchers, institutions, and communities.
5. PREMISE (therefore): Embedding these feedback loops allows research systems to learn from their own activity.
6. PREMISE (instantiated-by): talk4real applies a REPL-style cycle—read, evaluate, print, loop—to social and epistemic processes.
7. PREMISE (clarifies): This cycle links ethnography, computational analysis, design, and collective reflection.
8. EXAMPLE (illustrates): Related precedents include initiatives such as realtalk@MIT, PlanetMath.org, and Peeragogy.
9. PREMISE (therefore): We will run coordinated doctoral projects that instantiate the same learning architecture in distinct domains.
10. PREMISE (therefore): Each doctoral scholar becomes both a researcher and an agent of collective intelligence.
11. PREMISE (underpinned-by): The model is structured by three design principles.
12. PREMISE (specifies): Ethical reflexivity: participants co-author their representation.
13. PREMISE (specifies): Lightweight infrastructure: the method is portable and not locked to heavy platforms.
14. PREMISE (specifies): Polyphonic governance: multiple voices are synthesised, not averaged away.

Write ONE cohesive section that:

- Accurately conveys every backbone item (merging where appropriate).
- Respects roughly 250 words.
- Uses the style: Clear, concrete, funding-application English.
- Avoids introducing details absent from the backbone unless a hole explicitly requests it.

Outstanding prompts:
- Insert 1–2 current, funder-recognisable exemplars of collective-intelligence infrastructure.null
After writing, note which backbone items are addressed and revise once if any are weak.

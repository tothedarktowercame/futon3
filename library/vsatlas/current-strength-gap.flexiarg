! conclusion:
  Recognise that VSAT already excels at self-authored stories but does not yet
  help organisations see what a cohort’s stories reveal together.

  + context: You have built a system that supports individual storytelling but that doesn't yet help people see collective patterns across stories.
  + IF:
    Partners such as ACMi adopt VSAT for elegant individual storytelling.

  + HOWEVER:
    They cannot inspect the collective field; there is no support for linking or
    comparing stories to surface shared diagnosis.

  + THEN:
    Treat “collective understanding of stories” as the unmet need and scope any
    proof-of-concept around that gap.

  + BECAUSE:
    Without framing the gap explicitly, pilots will chase polish rather than the
    organisational question.

  + STATUS:

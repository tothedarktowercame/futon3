! conclusion:
  Treat the project as a gain-of-function probe into an uncharted layer of
  mathematical explanation: proof patterns that sit between informal hints and
  fully formal derivations.

  + IF:
    Mathematicians rely on recurring tactics—reduce to a simpler case, argue by
    symmetry, apply a standard lemma—that function like local proof patterns.

  + HOWEVER:
    Published texts only contain fragments of those tactics, mixed with
    exploratory and expository language; no systematic hierarchy exists, and a
    short pilot cannot derive one from scratch.

  + THEN:
    Focus on a small, curated corpus, amplify the strongest informal and
    expository cues through annotation, and test whether any stable pattern
    fragments can be identified consistently across examples.

  + BECAUSE:
    If such fragments can be linked to specific steps and objects, they provide
    the first empirical foothold on an underlying proof-pattern hierarchy. If
    they cannot, that result documents real limits on current methods.

  + NEXT STEPS:
    Tag recurring tactic descriptors that survive seminar scrutiny as candidate
    pattern atoms, report their frequencies and failure modes, and feed those
    findings into future, larger-scale work.

! conclusion: Not refraining-from but the desisting itself — the abstaining, abstinence, and refraining operating as factor of path in one intent on the undefiled.
  + context: This operates in one developing the noble path. It is "the desisting, abstaining, abstinence, and refraining from the four kinds of bad verbal conduct" — the faculty of verbal restraint itself, functioning cleanly.
  + IF:
    Even skilled refraining involves an abstainer — one who takes credit for not lying, who is proud of not being divisive. The refraining can become another form of self-construction.
  + HOWEVER:
    Speech continues — the question is whether it flows from identification or from the path functioning. What changes is not the content but the quality.
  + THEN:
    Noble right speech is the abstaining faculty operating in context of the path — desisting, abstaining, abstinence, refraining — as the natural expression of one oriented toward liberation. Not "I refrain" but refraining happening through one intent on the noble.
  + BECAUSE:
    The synonyms pile up (ārati, virati, paṭivirati, veramaṇī) to indicate the faculty from multiple angles, not the act of any actor. This is the verbal-conduct-shaping capacity operating without defilement.
  + TRANSCENDENT-QUALITY:
    - Not "I don't lie" but non-lying as expression of path
    - Speech that neither grasps at being heard nor avoids necessary communication
    - The verbal process transparent to path-factors
    - Abstaining that is not effortful but natural
  + THE-RUNNING-CIRCLE:
    "Right view, right effort, and right mindfulness keep running and circling around right speech" — understanding wrong and right speech (view), working to abandon wrong and cultivate right (effort), doing so mindfully.
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-MUNDANE:
    Mundane: "I refrain from wrong speech" (an I refraining)
    Noble: The abstaining faculty operating, intent on the undefiled
  + WORN-AWAY:
    "For one of right speech, wrong speech is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong speech are worn away."

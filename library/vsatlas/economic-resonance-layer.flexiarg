! conclusion:
  Allow emergent clusters to attach lightweight economic tools (mutual aid, microcredit, resource maps) to relational arcs.

  + context: You are exploring how narrative connections can be paired with lightweight economic tools so relational meaning aligns with material mutual support.
  + IF:
    Atomised interventions and isolated acts of generosity rarely create durable resilience.

  + HOWEVER:
    Story systems that operate purely at the narrative level ignore material alignment.

  + THEN:
    Allow emergent clusters to attach lightweight economic tools (mutual aid, microcredit, resource maps) to relational arcs.

  + BECAUSE:
    When narrative resonance aligns with economic mutuality, the manifold becomes regenerative rather than extractive.

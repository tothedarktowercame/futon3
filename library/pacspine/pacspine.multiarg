@arg pacspine/quick-intro
@title Pattern 1 — Quick Intro (Alignment Hook)
@sigils [✉️/桥 🧠/听]
! conclusion: Open with a precise bridge between the organisation’s core need and your distinctive strength.
IF: You have only a sentence or two to establish relevance.
HOWEVER: Most letters waste this window reciting CVs.
THEN: Lead with an elegant alignment hook that proves you understand their mission.
BECAUSE: Immediate resonance positions you as context-aware rather than generic.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Draft three hook sentences that pair partner needs with your proofs.]

@arg pacspine/channel-upgrade
@title Pattern 2 — Upgrade the Channel (Reveal the Real Ask)
@sigils [📡/问 🧿/察]
! conclusion: Name the deeper systemic challenge behind the stated requirement.
IF: Organisations voice surface-level needs.
HOWEVER: Echoing them verbatim makes you interchangeable.
THEN: Reframe their ask by articulating the underlying epistemic gap you can solve.
BECAUSE: People hire the candidate who understands the real problem.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Annotate each target org with “stated vs underlying” needs before writing.]

@arg pacspine/inception-move
@title Pattern 3 — Inception Move (Epistemic Entry Point)
@sigils [💡/探 🌀/入]
! conclusion: Offer one uncanny sentence that lets them feel your mind already inside their organisation.
IF: You want the reader to imagine you as an internal voice.
HOWEVER: Direct promises trigger resistance.
THEN: Drop a revelation-style line (time-travel, infrastructional x-ray) that seeds a new mental process they own.
BECAUSE: Inception beats persuasion; it shows lived understanding.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Collect vivid metaphors per organisation and rehearse delivering them in one line.]

@arg pacspine/goodwill
@title Pattern 4 — Secure Their Goodwill (Cultural Alignment)
@sigils [🤝/礼 🧵/度]
! conclusion: Demonstrate sensitivity to their pressures and describe how you slot into their workflow.
IF: You know the organisation’s constraints.
HOWEVER: Confidence without context reads as arrogance.
THEN: Mirror their cadence, name pressures, and show how you reduce friction.
BECAUSE: Teams back candidates who lighten load.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Write a cultural-alignment paragraph template per sector and customise before sending.]

@arg pacspine/crisp-success
@title Pattern 5 — Earn Their Approval (One Crisp Success)
@sigils [🏅/证 🧠/效]
! conclusion: Offer one achievement that maps elegantly onto their need.
IF: You want them to trust your competence.
HOWEVER: Long role histories dilute clarity.
THEN: Present a single, specific success tied to the desired outcome.
BECAUSE: Specificity builds credibility faster than volume.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Maintain a small library of “success vignettes” mapped to common needs.]

@arg pacspine/future-field
@title Pattern 6 — Get Them Excited (Open the Future Field)
@sigils [🚀/途 🌠/望]
! conclusion: Describe a modest, grounded future scenario enabled by your involvement.
IF: You need to shift from competence to possibility.
HOWEVER: Overpromising feels like hype.
THEN: Paint a reachable future anchored in their current trajectory plus your addition.
BECAUSE: Partners fund believable futures.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Sketch one “future vignette” per letter before drafting.]

@arg pacspine/bonus-layer
@title Pattern 7 — Signal the Further Benefit
@sigils [🎁/余 🧩/外]
! conclusion: Offer exactly one supplementary benefit beyond the brief.
IF: You already made a strong case.
HOWEVER: Overloading extras causes drag.
THEN: Add a single unexpected strength that meaningfully extends value.
BECAUSE: One delightful surprise invites curiosity without overwhelm.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Choose a rotating bench of bonus benefits; track which ones resonate.]

@arg pacspine/frictionless-next
@title Pattern 8 — Show Them How to Seal the Deal
@sigils [📞/起 🛤️/顺]
! conclusion: Provide a clear, low-friction next action.
IF: Interested readers still need direction.
HOWEVER: Ambiguous endings invite inertia.
THEN: Offer a concrete CTA (30-minute call, mini-prototype) sized to their bandwidth.
BECAUSE: Lower activation energy raises response rates.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Prepare CTA language for different readiness levels.]

@arg pacspine/ghost-move
@title Pattern 9 — Empower Them (Ghost Move)
@sigils [👻/信 ✨/续]
! conclusion: At the imagined close, strengthen trust by mirroring their unrealised potential.
IF: You want to leave relationships stronger even in exit scenarios.
HOWEVER: Most endings trigger anxiety.
THEN: Show that choosing you was already wise and hint at the larger opportunity they could unlock.
BECAUSE: Lasting goodwill keeps future engagements possible.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Draft closing paragraphs that celebrate the org’s latent trajectory.]

@arg pacspine/simple-close
@title Pattern 10 — Tie It All Together
@sigils [🔗/简 🌿/安]
! conclusion: Close with a simple human line that gathers the threads.
IF: You have woven alignment, insight, value, and next steps.
HOWEVER: Complex endings create drag.
THEN: Return to a clean, confident sentence that feels inevitable.
BECAUSE: Simplicity signals maturity.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Collect exemplar closing lines and reuse the cadence, not the wording.]

@arg pacspine/indicators-checker
@title Pattern 11 — Indicators Checker
@sigils [🧮/衡 🧠/检]
! conclusion: Use a shared checklist to verify Pac-Spine quality.
IF: Subjective impressions cause inconsistent letters.
HOWEVER: Without indicators, quality drifts across 20 letters.
THEN: Check for hook, reframing, CTA, cultural alignment, crisp success, future vignette, single bonus, frictionless CTA, empowerment move, and clean ending.
BECAUSE: Uniform standards keep the set coherent.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Embed the indicator list into the drafting template.]

@arg pacspine/obligations-checker
@title Pattern 12 — Obligations Checker
@sigils [🧭/誓 🛡️/诚]
! conclusion: Keep letters sincere and self-protective while tailoring each one.
IF: Writing many letters risks fragmentation.
HOWEVER: Templates can flatten voice.
THEN: Commit to obligations (preserve voice, no invention, honour paramitā hinge) that keep the art-book frame intact.
BECAUSE: This harness protects integrity while projecting facets deliberately.
STATUS: status[ready]
NEXT: next[Publish the obligations list alongside the drafting schedule.]

! conclusion:
  Test your conjecture at the boundaries: zero, infinity, the empty set, the trivial case.

  + context: You have a general statement and want to know if it is plausible before investing in a proof.
  + IF:
      The statement involves a parameter, a set, or a structure that can take degenerate or
      extreme values.

  + HOWEVER:
      Extreme cases can be vacuously true or pathologically special, giving false confidence.
      Passing extreme-case checks is necessary but not sufficient.

  + THEN:
      Instantiate the statement at every extreme: n=0, n=1, the empty set, the one-point space,
      the trivial group, infinite dimension, the identity morphism. Check whether the statement
      is true, vacuously true, or false. A failure at an extreme case is a cheap disproof.

  + BECAUSE:
      Extreme cases are the cheapest tests available. Many false conjectures die at n=0. Many
      correct theorems reveal their essential content at the boundary.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[List all parameters and identify their extreme values.]
    next[Evaluate the statement at each extreme.]
    next[Record which extremes are informative vs vacuous.]

! conclusion: Develop unified concentration through the four jhanas — progressively deeper states of absorption characterized by joy, ease, equanimity, and refined awareness.
  + context: This operates in formal practice where attention becomes stable enough to rest without distraction. Concentration provides the platform for insight.
  + IF:
    The scattered mind cannot see clearly — too fragmented, too reactive, too caught up in proliferation. Some degree of stability is prerequisite for wisdom.
  + HOWEVER:
    Concentration states can become ends in themselves — blissful resting places that don't lead to liberation. And attachment to jhana can become subtle spiritual materialism. The problem is not concentration but concentration disconnected from wisdom.
  + THEN:
    Develop the four jhanas: (1) first jhana with applied and sustained thought, joy and ease born of seclusion, (2) second jhana with joy and ease born of concentration, internal clarity, (3) third jhana with equanimous ease, mindful awareness, (4) fourth jhana with pure equanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.
  + BECAUSE:
    Mundane right concentration creates conditions for clear seeing — the stable, unified mind can investigate experience without being swept away. But one can attain jhana while still attached to the states themselves, to being a "jhana attainer," to the bliss and refinement. This is better than wrong concentration but not yet liberation — it leads to rebirth in Brahma realms, not to nibbana.
  + MUNDANE-CONTENT:
    - First jhana: seclusion from hindrances, joy and ease arise
    - Second jhana: thought subsides, concentration deepens
    - Third jhana: joy fades, equanimous ease remains
    - Fourth jhana: pure equanimity, refined mindfulness
  + DISTINGUISHING-FROM-WRONG-CONCENTRATION:
    Wrong concentration: absorption that reinforces defilement or doesn't lead anywhere
    Mundane right concentration: four jhanas — AND awareness that the states can be grasped
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Establish the prerequisites: ethics, contentment, sense restraint, clear comprehension, mindfulness.
    - Learn to recognize and stabilize each jhana factor.
    - Use concentration as platform for investigation, not as final goal.
  + RIPENS-IN:
    Deep peace, refined awareness, powerful platform for insight — but if disconnected from the other factors, leads only to refined rebirth, not liberation.

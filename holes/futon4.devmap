! instantiated-by: Prototype 0 (Running Since 29 July 2025) [🌀/己 🗂️/上]
  + context: Prototype 0 establishes the symbolic foundations, artefact inventory, and DREAM logic.
  + if: You want a coherent first cycle of a year-long 12-prototype run.
  + however: Symbolic activation does not yet translate into memory operations or agent affordances.
  + then: Establish baseline artefacts (README-manifesto, clock interface, Arxana reboot outline).
  + because: This creates an anchor for all subsequent prototypes.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Arxana Reboot (Week-long target) [💾/工 ✂️/刀]
  + context: Legacy literate-programming structure exists but is dormant.
  + if: You want stable parsing, node navigation, and save-back-to-LaTeX working.
  + however: Legacy Emacs-Lisp and refactored Clojure schemas diverge.
  + then: Reboot spine parser, restore node browsing, define new nema-based schema, test round-trip edits.
  + because: A functioning editor is the precondition for all downstream memory work.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Graph Memory (Datascript) [🕸️/井 💾/工]
  + context: You have a beta-schema for hyperedges and future XTDB integration.
  + if: You want to reconstruct context, track provenance, and store argument blocks as graph nodes.
  + however: No working memory manager yet connects Arxana to the graph.
  + then: Implement minimal add-node, activate-node, link-node operations.
  + because: This allows symbolic memory to become operational.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 3 — Flexiarg ⇄ Arxana Integration [📝/己 🔄/入]
  + context: Flexiarg is acting as a pidgin for arguments and patterns.
  + if: You want arguments to compile into graph nodes and be editable via Arxana.
  + however: No translation layer exists between pidgin text and structured memory entries.
  + then: Define schema mapping: argument-block → rule node (Q/A pair).
  + because: This yields bidirectional editing: human-readable ↔ machine-structured.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 4 — Agent Layer Bridge (FUTON3) [🤖/工 🔌/口]
  + context: Agents can “speak” flexiarg but cannot yet access memory graphs.
  + if: You want pattern-aware agents who can detect tension, link motifs, and apply PIDGIN→PROSE.
  + however: No API exists to let a GPT-based agent query the graph.
  + then: Create REPL-level bridge (datascript queries + JSON-rpc + Emacs functions).
  + because: This is what upgrades GPT into a pattern-capable agent.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Multi-user Memory (MUSN revival) [🤝/女 📚/门]
  + context: MUSN existed as a concept for multi-user semantic memory.
  + if: You want collaborators (Serena, Rob, Harvinder, etc.) to share a semantic space.
  + however: No multi-user or sync layer exists yet.
  + then: Use Datascript local + XTDB remote as stepping stones.
  + because: This will open the door to multi-agent co-reasoning and shared prototyping.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 6 — Argumentarium / Scholium Mode [📚/门 🧠/己]
  + context: You want something like Spinoza’s *Ethics* but with imports, hypergraphs, and links.
  + if: You want a library of arguments with provenance, alternative proofs, counterproofs.
  + however: Current flexiargs do not yet link into a live scholium tree.
  + then: Add scholium metadata + “view scholium tree” mode in Arxana.
  + because: This becomes the living mathematical-philosophical substrate.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 7 — XTDB Integration [💾/工 ⏳/日]
  + context: Bi-temporal, multi-user storage needed for long-term evolution.
  + if: You want durability, branching histories, provenance queries.
  + however: XTDB idioms differ from Datascript; schema migration needed.
  + then: Rekey schema, add transaction logs, implement time-travel queries.
  + because: This turns Arxana into a serious memory engine.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 8 — Pattern Library Activation [🧩/子 🧠/己]
  + context: You have dozens of patterns (Mojo, ORP, Paramita, Flexiarg, etc.).
  + if: You want agents to recommend patterns or detect pattern-relevant situations.
  + however: Patterns are not yet encoded in memory or linked to triggers.
  + then: Import patterns as graph rules; map IF/HOWEVER/THEN/BECAUSE into triggers & actions.
  + because: This yields genuine pattern-aware intelligence.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 9 — StackExchange Import [❓/口 📥/入]
  + context: You want Q/A pairs to become production rules in the memory graph.
  + if: You want to explore deep structure of Q/A logic across large corpora.
  + however: No importer is built yet.
  + then: Build parser → unify with internal Q/A schema → cross-index.
  + because: This enriches the graph with thousands of high-quality rules.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 10 — Corpus Mathematics Layer [📐/十 🧮/工]
  + context: You want to bridge natural/formal logic (Strand 1B).
  + if: You want Dirichlet distributions and Abelian groups to live in the same memory model.
  + however: No symbolic math integration exists yet.
  + then: Build math namespace + flexiarg-lemma type + REPL test harness.
  + because: This is how FUTON becomes an “AI Scientist.”

! instantiated-by: Prototype 11 — Literary Interface (Penmaster) [📖/夕 ✍️/工]
  + context: You want Arxana to also serve as a book-editing and generative-literary tool.
  + if: You want to edit Penmaster or draft your book via Arxana blocks.
  + however: No good UI for long-form text yet.
  + then: Add “manuscript mode” + chunking + cross-reference map.
  + because: FUTON becomes the writing environment.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 12 — Year-End Synthesis [🔄/入 🌀/己]
  + context: The prototype cycle ends; reflection and forward-planning needed.
  + if: You want long-term stability, and upgraded beta-schema.
  + however: Accumulated divergence between prototypes must be unified.
  + then: Run full PAR + CLA + DREAM integration cycle.
  + because: This sets the stage for FUTON5+.

! conclusion:
  When a system exceeds the holding capacity of its participants (agents,
  humans, or both), it must decompose. Consensus reality treats this as
  abstraction — lossy compression that discards detail. Futon theory treats
  it as individuation — the recognition that the compound symbol already
  encoded its own decomposition. The interaction between individuated parts
  is itself a perceivable compound symbol with recoverable internal structure.

  + context: The symbolic geodesic pattern describes the shortest path
    through symbolic state space — individual trajectories from intent to
    verified claim. But mathematical practice and software development
    involve not just individual paths but interactions between paths:
    how does this subsystem's output become that subsystem's input? How
    do three agents coordinate across three timescales? The interaction
    itself has structure, and that structure can be perceived as a symbol.

  + THE-CONSENSUS-VIEW:
    All participants have bounded holding capacity. Joe can hold N things.
    Claude can hold M. Codex can hold K. When a system's complexity exceeds
    min(N, M, K), coordination breaks down — not because any participant
    is deficient but because the system has grown beyond what can be held
    as one thing. The consensus response is abstraction: name the parts,
    draw boundaries, interact through interfaces. This works but treats
    the decomposition as an engineering decision — "we chose to split
    futon3 into three repos because it was getting complex."

  + THE-FUTONIC-VIEW:
    The decomposition was not chosen. It was perceived. The compound
    symbol already contained its decomposition in its internal structure,
    just as 鹽 (salt) contains 鹵 (鹵: saline-land, brine-source) + 皿
    (皿: dish, vessel, container). The character does not abbreviate the
    salt-making process — it encodes it: brine from saline land refined
    into a vessel. The structure is recoverable from the symbol.

    When futon3 individuated into futon3a/3b/3c, the split followed
    structural lines that were already present:
    - futon3a (query) operated at fast/query timescale
    - futon3b (development) operated at task + glacial timescale
    - futon3c (realtime) operated at social/realtime timescale

    These timescales were not imposed by the split — they were the reason
    the split became perceivable. The compound symbol "futon3" contained
    three processes at three timescales. When complexity exceeded holding
    capacity, the internal structure surfaced as three individuated symbols.

  + SYMBOLIC-GEODESICS-AND-INTERACTIONS:
    The symbolic geodesic pattern describes individual paths:
      spec → proof → verified claim

    Individuation adds a second level: interactions between paths:
      (futon3c dispatches agent) → (futon3b validates through gates) →
      (futon3b L1 canonicalizes) → (futon3a queries the result)

    This interaction pattern is itself a compound symbol. It has internal
    structure (the timescale ordering), a process-origin (why social feeds
    into task feeds into glacial), and a decomposition (the individual
    loops). Just as 鹽 can be perceived as one thing (salt) or decomposed
    (brine-source + vessel), the three-futon interaction can be perceived
    as one thing (the futon stack's coordination architecture) or decomposed
    (three loops at three timescales with defined interaction points).

  + WHAT-INDIVIDUATION-PRESERVES:
    When a compound symbol individuates:
    1. The parts retain their interaction structure (they know how to
       compose because they were composed before the split)
    2. The compound symbol remains available (you can still talk about
       "the futon3 stack" even after the split)
    3. The decomposition is auditable (why these boundaries, not others?)
    4. The interaction between parts is a compound symbol in its own right
       (the "War Room" level coordination pattern)

    What individuation does NOT do:
    - It does not discard the relationships between parts
    - It does not create new structure (it reveals existing structure)
    - It does not require the parts to be independent (they interact
      through defined ports, like AIF wiring diagram components)

  + PERCEIVING-FUTURE-INTERACTIONS:
    The symbolic geodesic says: you can perceive future elements in the
    present by tracing symbolic paths (specs, proofs, program types).

    Individuation extends this: you can perceive future interactions
    between elements by tracing the compound symbol's internal structure.
    If I specify futon3b's gate pipeline and futon3c's agency dispatch
    separately, I can perceive their interaction before they are connected —
    because the compound symbol (the coordination architecture) encodes
    the interaction in its timescale structure.

    This is not prediction. It is perception of structure that is already
    present in the symbols. The future interaction is not uncertain — it
    is encoded. The only question is whether the participants have the
    holding capacity to perceive the encoding.

    This is why "please pass the salt" and the 鹽 decomposition are
    not two descriptions of the same thing. The speech act treats salt
    as an opaque referent. The decomposition treats it as a structured
    symbol whose internal process (brine + vessel → salt) is perceivable.
    Both are true. The futonic perspective does not replace consensus
    reality — it adds the structural layer that makes interaction
    between symbols perceivable as symbols in their own right.

  + HOLDING-CAPACITY-AS-TIMESCALE:
    Why does complexity exceed holding capacity? Because participants
    operate at characteristic timescales. Joe sleeps and his "context
    compacts overnight." Claude's context window fills and compresses.
    Codex processes one task at a time. These are timescale constraints
    on the participants, analogous to the timescale constraints on the
    system (I3: timescale separation).

    The structural correspondence: the system's timescale separation
    (fast/task/glacial/social) mirrors the participants' holding capacity
    limits (context windows, sleep cycles, working memory). Both drive
    individuation. Both are structural, not accidental.

    A system that perfectly matched its participants' holding capacity
    would never need to individuate. But real systems grow, and real
    participants have finite windows. Individuation is how growth and
    finitude coexist.

  + RELATIONSHIP-TO-OTHER-PATTERNS:
    - symbolic-geodesic: individual paths; individuation is about
      interactions between paths
    - structural-tension-as-observation: tension drives glacial loop;
      individuation is what happens when tension exceeds holding capacity
      at the compound level
    - retroactive-canonicalization: the individuated parts become
      candidates for canonicalization as first-class entities
    - theory-as-exotype: the compound symbol's internal structure IS
      the exotype that constrains how parts interact after individuation

  + BECAUSE:
    Without this pattern, decomposition appears arbitrary — an engineering
    convenience, not a structural necessity. With it, decomposition is the
    natural consequence of compound symbols whose internal structure
    becomes perceivable when complexity exceeds holding capacity. The
    three-futon split is not a refactoring decision but a perception
    event: the moment when futon3's internal timescale structure surfaced
    as three individuated symbols, each carrying its own process-origin,
    each interacting through the compound symbol they emerged from.

  + EVIDENCE:
    evidence[futon3 → futon3a/3b/3c split followed timescale boundaries already present in code]
    evidence[War Room document (holes/war-room.md) captures the compound interaction structure]
    evidence[futon3b mission complete and coherent without reference to Agency/Forum/peripherals]
    evidence[futon3c's 13 realtime patterns disjoint from futon3b's 12 coordination patterns]
    evidence[Codex produced "buzzword potpourri" when holding capacity exceeded by mission complexity — individuation resolved the comprehension gap by reducing each part to holdable size]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Verify that interaction between 3a/3b/3c is itself expressible as an AIF wiring diagram]
    next[Add individuation events to the canonicalization record format]
    next[Test whether the compound symbol (futon3 stack) remains queryable via futon3a search after the split]

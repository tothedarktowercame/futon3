! conclusion:
  Design for peer-to-peer audiences by enabling reciprocal storytelling loops and navigable inter-story connections.

  + context: You are rethinking platform design so audiences become active participants who respond to and connect with each other’s stories, rather than remaining passive viewers.
  + IF:
    The platform centres display logic so stories attract passive spectators.

  + HOWEVER:
    Communities require environments where participants recognise and respond to one another as peers.

  + THEN:
    Design for peer-to-peer audiences by enabling reciprocal storytelling loops and navigable inter-story connections.

  + BECAUSE:
    Shifting the audience from spectators to participants restores agency, dialogue, and collective problem-solving.

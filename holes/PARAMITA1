PAR CASE FILE — 23 November 2025

SPHERES: Reflective, Infrastructure, Technical
OBLIGATIONS:

Perform well in job → 🟣 insufficient evidence today

Job search → 🟣 none mentioned

Enough exercise → low (1)

Enough sleep → strong (4)

INTENTION
Re-engage with gardening and test improved prompting/tools; explore winter-viable actions that match values.

WHAT HAPPENED
Used quiet, cold office time to explore weather options, curl/Open-Meteo queries, and gardening viability (garlic still plantable; broad beans possible). Clarified daylight-friendly windows (morning/lunch). Ran tool-testing mid-conversation. Worked on an electronic EP and shared with family.

PERSPECTIVES
Friends would see this as healthy self-care and a gentle restart of outdoor habits. Another perspective: tending “life-garden” plots of values, habits, tools. Systemically, short winter days push toward small, contained actions. Bodily experience: cold, quiet office supporting focused reflection.

LEARNING
Surface: late-November garlic is fine; useful curl patterns; sunlight timing.
Pattern: small daylight visits beat waiting for perfect conditions; low-friction prep increases action likelihood.
Shift: seeing tools + values + habits as a single “tending” process.

FORWARD ADJUSTMENTS
One daylight allotment visit this week to plant garlic; keep a tiny go-bag; maintain lightweight logging via new setup; avoid waiting for long evening windows.

CONVOLUTION SIGNALS

Mood: 4

Clarity: 3–4 (emerging direction)

Identity: tending-mindset strengthening

Practice: low-friction garden + tool habits forming

@factor Keen investigation (dhammavicaya)

! conclusion:
  follow the devmap contribution protocol
    1. Clock in on one futon + prototype before writing code: update the clause’s `+ next[...]` with `doing[...] owner[...] evidence[...]` (or `blocked-by[...]`), and ensure the futon-level `@state/@next` reflect reality.
    2. Build the evidence: run the futon3 helper stack from this repo (`clojure -M:sigils`, `scripts/check_devmap_next.clj` once it lands, Tatami trails) so sigils, next-tags, and proof trails stay coherent.
    3. Clock out: replace the clause’s `+ next[...]` with `done[...] evidence[...]` (or `start` for untouched designs), note any new blockers, regenerate `holes/artifacts/devmaps.pdf`, and mention the futon/prototype in the commit or work log.

  + context: You are touching devmaps or prototypes and need the devmap state to stay auditable.
  + IF:
    contributors touch devmaps, prototypes, or interface tooling

  + HOWEVER:
    without an explicit “clock-in” ritual the `@state` tags and `+ next[...]` hooks drift, leaving future runs unable to tell what moved or who touched a clause

  + THEN:
    follow the devmap contribution protocol

  + BECAUSE:
    keeping `next[...]` hooks and futon-level state current is how humans and FUTON3’s coherence checks agree on what changed and what to do next.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Pick one active devmap clause and walk it through the clock-in and clock-out ritual to validate the protocol.]

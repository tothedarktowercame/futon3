! conclusion: Xiangqi-Inspired Decorators
+IF: OR2 patterns describe tensions carried by distinct Brookes roles but there is no shared notation tying nodes to their positional logic on the topology map.
+HOWEVER: Without visible decorators, PVC, ORPM, UKRN, Library, and School roles blur; newcomers cannot tell whether a pattern concerns mandate, horizon, stewardship, or frontline action.
+THEN: Borrow symbolic Xiangqi cues—Cannon for UKRN (UP), General + Advisor for the Two Joes (CENTER), Elephant for Library (DOWN), Chariots for Schools—and render them as minimal icons that sit beside each pattern header. Publish a legend so non-specialists can parse the map instantly.
+BECAUSE: Decorators make institutional tensions legible at a glance, improving navigability, pattern casting, and recognition of positional constraints without resorting to heavy prose or cultural caricature.

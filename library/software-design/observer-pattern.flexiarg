@sigils [💎/介]
! conclusion: 以訂閱機制解耦事件發布與處理。
  + context: Multiple components need to react to state changes in a subject.
  + if: You want to avoid tight coupling or hard-coded call chains.
  + however: Direct calls lock in dependencies and make extensions expensive.
  + then: Introduce a subject that publishes events to observers registered for specific signals.
  + because: The publisher remains stable while observers evolve independently.
  + next-steps:
    - Track observer lifetimes to avoid leaks; test that events fire once per change.
    - evidence-shape: {:observer/subject :string, :observer/events [:string], :observer/subscribers [:string]}

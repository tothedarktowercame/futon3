! conclusion: Design practices that contain recurring tension instead of trying to purify it into moral closure.
  + context: In social or institutional settings, recurring tensions persist despite good intentions.
  + IF:
    You encounter ethical tension that reliably reappears and cannot be removed without denial, repression, or coercive control.
  + HOWEVER:
    Treating the tension as something to be morally resolved collapses complexity and turns ethics into governance or policing.
  + THEN:
    Design practices that contain the tension, localizing it in shared, repeatable forms that allow expression and circulation without claiming moral closure.
  + BECAUSE:
    Ethical coherence under pressure depends on preventing collapse into denial or domination, not on eliminating constitutive forces.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Test whether a proposed solution suppresses the tension or merely relocates it.
    - Compare failure modes of moralization versus containment.

! conclusion:
  Assume the negation of what you want to prove and derive an absurdity.

  + context: You want to prove a statement P and no direct construction or chain of implications is apparent.
  + IF:
      The conclusion P is existential ("there exists..."), uniqueness ("at most one..."), or
      impossibility ("no X satisfies..."), and direct proof routes are blocked.

  + HOWEVER:
      Proofs by contradiction can obscure the constructive content of a result, making it harder to
      extract algorithms or explicit witnesses. Some mathematical communities prefer direct proofs
      when available.

  + THEN:
      Assume not-P. Use the assumed structure to build or derive objects, then show these objects
      violate a known fact. The contradiction forces P.

  + BECAUSE:
      Contradiction proofs gain traction by giving you an extra hypothesis (not-P) to work with.
      Many fundamental results (irrationality of sqrt(2), uncountability of the reals, infinitude
      of primes) were first proved this way.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Write down the precise negation of P.]
    next[Identify what new objects or properties not-P gives you.]
    next[Find the known fact that these objects violate.]

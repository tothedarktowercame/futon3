@factor Concentration (samādhi)
@IFR: FUTON5 operates as the samādhi (concentration) engine, turning improvisation, CT riffs, musical chops, and Nonstarter economics into renewable practices that keep creativity gathered without teleological drag.
@state Design-only plan; prototypes have narrative intent but no running code or artefacts yet.
@next start


! instantiated-by: Prototype 0 — Nonstarter Frame (Concentration without Teleology) [👴/乃 🍊/不能]
  + context: FUTON5 is the samādhi layer: gathering energy around chosen patterns, sustaining focus, and refusing the teleology of success so value is created without capture and creativity concentrates without collapse.
  + if: You want a layer that stabilises creative practice (music, coding, argument, CT diagrams) into repeatable, renewable flows.
  + however: Current prototypes (MetaCA, flexiarg, musical studies, CT notes) sit in isolation and do not yet form a concentrated practice ecology.
  + then: Define FUTON5 as the layer where prototypes from F4 are refined into systems—pattern libraries, CT riffs, musical grammars, improvisation logics, Nonstarter economics—so concentrated practice can run independent of outcome-chasing.
  + because: Without a stable concentrator layer, FUTON4’s tranquility and FUTON6’s argument power cannot synergise.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 1 — Patterns of Improvisation (Music ⇄ Math ⇄ CT) [👈/归 🔃/世]
  + context: You have identified a major through-line: improvisation = category theory = MetaCA = design patterns = your life practice.
  + if: You want FUTON5 to unify musical, mathematical, and pattern improvisation into one coherent substrate.
  + however: Music theory, CT, and symbolic improvisation currently live in different notebooks, chats, and memory fragments.
  + then: Create a small “Patterns of Improvisation” protobook with 8–12 patterns (e.g., Prototype → Production, Kleisli Turn, Return to I, Phase-Switch, Noise Budget, Concentration Spiral), express each as riff + CT sketch + musical example + MetaCA mapping, and store them as structured F5 nodes consumable by F4 (Arxana) and F6 (argumentarium).
  + because: An integrated improvisation grammar becomes FUTON5’s internal “samādhi engine.”

! instantiated-by: Prototype 2 — Concentration Engine (Chops, Not Goals) [👴/工 💖/己]
  + context: Concentration in F5 is about capacity, not outcomes: sustained work on craft (music, CT, code) without dangling the carrot of “success.”
  + if: You want a system for renewable, non-self-punishing discipline.
  + however: Current practice cycles depend heavily on mood, projects, or institutional demands.
  + then: Establish a “Concentration Engine” protocol with 3–5 stable practice grooves (bass technique, CT reading, coding drills, MetaCA tinkering), ensure each groove has low activation energy and clear termination points, and track them in FUTON5 as patterns rather than habits.
  + because: Concentration emerges from rhythm, not obligation.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 3 — Pattern Library (Post-Flexiarg) [💖/但是 💬/世]
  + context: Flexiarg formalises arguments (F6) while FUTON5 formalises patterns.
  + if: You want a domain-agnostic, cross-modal pattern language scaffold that sits between Arxana and the argumentarium.
  + however: Existing patterns are scattered across papers (P4P, P4D, P4NG) and are not harmonised.
  + then: Define a minimal F5 pattern schema (@pattern-id, IF/HOWEVER/THEN/BECAUSE where useful, examples across music/code/CT/life, invariants/failure modes, “improvisation affordances”) and refactor 6–12 core patterns into that schema.
  + because: FUTON5 needs a pattern substrate that can plug directly into FUTON6’s argument logic.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 4 — MetaCA as Improvisation Physics [👴/己 🌀/我]
  + context: MetaCA is your 2014 prototype of local-rule self-evolution and mirrors your 2025 simulation-based self-understanding.
  + if: You want to reinterpret MetaCA as the “physics” of improvisation: everything evolves locally but is constrained globally by a deep rule (Dhamma / AIF).
  + however: MetaCA code exists, yet its conceptual integration with FUTON5 is not explicit.
  + then: Reframe MetaCA as an F5 conceptual engine where local rules equal riffs/CT arrows/pattern transforms, the global rule embodies AIF, edge-of-chaos represents productive creativity, collapse modes name burnout/ego/overcontrol, and capture this in one short essay inside the F5 devmap.
  + because: This gives FUTON5 a mathematical “feel” that is embodied, generative, and non-institutional.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 5 — Nonstarter Social Physics [💰/无 👴/元]
  + context: Nonstarter = anti-teleology, refusal of capture, joy in giving, Patti Smith energy, LANDBACK aesthetics.
  + if: You want FUTON5 not only to concentrate craft but to concentrate value without reproducing institutional extraction.
  + however: There is no current model linking creative concentration with non-extractive flows.
  + then: Define a simple Nonstarter Ledger inside F5 that tracks “value given” (hours, riffs, patterns released), “value received” (collaboration, uplift, resonance), enforces a “no-ask posture” protocol, encodes reciprocity loops based on pattern contribution rather than money, and distinguishes RESCUE requests from COLLABORATION requests.
  + because: With a functional Nonstarter economy, FUTON5 becomes spiritually and materially sustainable.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 6 — Improvisation Metrics (Not KPIs) [👈/归 😻/叉]
  + context: Metrics destroy creativity when tied to teleology.
  + if: You want a way to sense concentration without collapsing into institutional logic.
  + however: No metrics currently track musical, cognitive, or conceptual “chops.”
  + then: Define a set of “Improvisation Indicators” (Noise Budget, Flow Duration, Surprise-to-Stability Ratio, Return-to-I Coherence, Cross-Domain Lift between music/writing/coding) and track them qualitatively in F5 without gamification.
  + because: FUTON5 needs feedback, not surveillance.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 7 — F4⇄F5⇄F6 Conduction Pathways [👐/什么]
  + context: F4 is tranquility, F6 is war machine, and F5 is the samādhi bridge.
  + if: You want to flow smoothly between relaxed inscription (F4), concentrated craft (F5), and structured reasoning (F6).
  + however: There is no explicit pathway linking the three.
  + then: Define three conduction modes—F4→F5 (prototype → practice, what to work on today), F5→F6 (practice → argument, what becomes a formal insight), F6→F5 (argument → pattern, what needs to be embodied)—and document these flows as short “transmission patterns.”
  + because: Without conduction, the stack fragments instead of concentrating.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 8 — 12-Prototype Year (Concentration Arc) [👴/年 💑/岁]
  + context: You are already running a 12-prototype year.
  + if: You want FUTON5 to shape it into a concentration arc rather than a sequence of builds.
  + however: There is no formal mapping of prototypes to F5 themes.
  + then: Assign each prototype a concentration domain (MetaCA, Patterns of Improvisation, CT chops, Musical chops, Flexiarg → pattern transforms, Nonstarter ledger, Pattern economy, F5 system interfaces, Meta-Improvisation, AIF integration, Relational improvisation patterns, Year-end coherence synthesis) and keep the map current as the year unfolds.
  + because: Concentration deepens through cyclical return.

! instantiated-by: Prototype 9 — Yearly F5 Review (Concentration Renewal) [👴/口 🌝/这样]
  + context: Concentration weakens if not refreshed.
  + if: You want F5 to stay light, concentrated, and improvisational rather than dogmatic.
  + however: Without review, patterns accrete into heaviness.
  + then: Run a yearly cycle that prunes dead patterns, refines musical grammars, updates CT riffs, consolidates improvisation patterns, refreshes the Nonstarter ethos, and removes anything that smells like KPIs.
  + because: Concentration equals aliveness, and aliveness must be renewed.

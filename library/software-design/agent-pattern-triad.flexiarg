! conclusion:
  Make the pipeline explicit: intent parsing emits Commands, a SchedulingStrategy selects the next move, and decorators (logging, timing, synchronisation, permission checks, orb tracking) wrap each command before worker threads call `execute!`. Document this flow with diagrams and a toy agent lab so newcomers can trace how intent, policy, and meta-behaviour interact.

  + context: You are teaching the command/strategy/decorator triad for agent systems.

  + if:
    Students and maintainers often encounter Command, Strategy, and Decorator as isolated textbook animals, so multi-agent architectures feel like a zoo with no wiring diagram.

  + however:
    FUTON stacks already rely on commands to carry work, strategies to choose policies, and decorators to enforce cross-cutting rules; failing to name the triad keeps the system opaque.

  + then:
    Make the pipeline explicit: intent parsing emits Commands, a SchedulingStrategy selects the next move, and decorators (logging, timing, synchronisation, permission checks, orb tracking) wrap each command before worker threads call `execute!`. Document this flow with diagrams and a toy agent lab so newcomers can trace how intent, policy, and meta-behaviour interact.

  + because:
    The Command/Strategy/Decorator triad turns “random agent code” into an explainable circuit—what gets done, how choices are made, and which protections wrap the work—so experimentation stays safe, reasoning stays legible, and multi-threaded agents behave predictably.

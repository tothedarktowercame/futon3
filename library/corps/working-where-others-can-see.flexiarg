! instantiated-by: Working Where Others Can See
+if: A project depends on mutual visibility of tasks, decisions, and intermediate outputs, yet the researcher’s workflow remains private or idiosyncratic.
+however: Teams cannot coordinate or intervene early when work stays on personal drives or in opaque notebooks.
+then: Move key elements of the workflow into shared spaces—open notes, reproducible scripts, transparent task boards—and annotate decision points so colleagues can interpret and respond without extra meetings.
+because: Collaboration relies on visible work surfaces. When intermediate steps are reviewable, teams reduce duplication, coordinate effectively, and offer support before issues harden into blockers.

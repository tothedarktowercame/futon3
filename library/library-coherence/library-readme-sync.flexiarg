@title Canon ↔ README Sync Ritual
@sigils [🔃/本 🚞/习]
@references [stack-coherence/readme-devmap-sync devmap-coherence/baseline-freeze]

! conclusion:
  run the same sync ritual used on devmaps: diff the pattern store against README anchors, refuse to mark a pattern “ready” until the corresponding section exists (line references + timestamps), and capture the sync status inside the `library-coherence` ledger; when drift is detected, emit follow-up tasks and freeze the affected prototype until docs ship

  + context: You are keeping README narratives aligned with the pattern canon.
  + IF:
    the README, devmaps, and pattern canon are supposed to tell the same story about what FUTON3 (and neighbours) actually ship

  + HOWEVER:
    README sections routinely lag behind the pattern store—new handlers or adapters show up in code/tests but never get cited as evidence, so prototypes appear “done” without a published description

  + THEN:
    run the same sync ritual used on devmaps: diff the pattern store against README anchors, refuse to mark a pattern “ready” until the corresponding section exists (line references + timestamps), and capture the sync status inside the `library-coherence` ledger; when drift is detected, emit follow-up tasks and freeze the affected prototype until docs ship

  + BECAUSE:
    the canon exists to keep the public story honest—without README coverage, pattern maturity is impossible to audit

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add a README-sync checklist entry for the next pattern marked ready.]

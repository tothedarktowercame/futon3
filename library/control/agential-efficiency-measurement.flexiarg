! conclusion:
  When building agential coding infrastructure, measure token consumption and execution time as proxies for energy usage

  + context: You are building systems where AI agents perform significant computational work (code generation, analysis, search).
  + IF:
    Agential coding can increase productivity and enable new capabilities

  + HOWEVER:
    Current energy usage patterns for AI inference are non-trivial; without measurement, efficiency claims are unfounded

  + THEN:
    Instrument all agent operations to measure: tokens consumed (input + output), wall-clock time, retries/failures. Log these metrics per mission/session. Compare agent-assisted work against human-only baseline where possible.

  + BECAUSE:
    (1) Planetary: Energy efficiency matters. If agential coding is less efficient than human coding, that's a real cost.
    (2) Economic: People will pay for proven efficiency gains. Unmeasured efficiency is a claim, not a fact.
    (3) Optimization: You can only improve what you measure. Metrics reveal where agents waste tokens on unproductive loops.

  + EVIDENCE:
    evidence[futon3a/P4 (mission queue) includes pass criterion for token/time measurement per mission]
    evidence[futon3a sidecar logs include session duration and turn counts (proxy for token use)]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add token counters to all fucodex/fuclaude sessions (input tokens, output tokens, total)]
    next[Log mission-level metrics: tokens/mission, time/mission, success rate]
    next[Baseline: measure human time for equivalent tasks (where feasible)]
    next[After 10+ missions: analyze whether night-shift automation is more efficient than equivalent human work]
    next[If efficiency gains are proven: document them; if not: identify waste and optimize]

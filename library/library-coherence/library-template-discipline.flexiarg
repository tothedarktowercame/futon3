! conclusion:
  enforce a canonical template across every `library/**.flexiarg`: lint for required metadata, forbid renaming the clause markers, and add CI that refuses commits lacking `@sigils`, `@references`, or the standard clause order; every pattern added to `resources/pattern_store.edn` must cite the lint status

  + context: You are standardising flexiarg structure so tooling can ingest and validate the canon.
  + IF:
    devmaps and flexiarg libraries already follow a template (meta tags, IF/HOWEVER/THEN/BECAUSE, sigils)

  + HOWEVER:
    new patterns often copy-paste partial headers, omit `@sigils`, or rename clauses, so the store can’t ingest them uniformly

  + THEN:
    enforce a canonical template across every `library/**.flexiarg`: lint for required metadata, forbid renaming the clause markers, and add CI that refuses commits lacking `@sigils`, `@references`, or the standard clause order; every pattern added to `resources/pattern_store.edn` must cite the lint status

  + BECAUSE:
    the canon only works when patterns stay machine-readable—template drift makes the check DSL brittle and the README evidence unverifiable

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Add a lint check that fails when required metadata or clause order is missing.]

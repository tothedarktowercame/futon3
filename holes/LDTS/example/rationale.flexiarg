! conclusion: talk4real is justified as an infrastructure for collective intelligence because it converts accumulative, non-reflective research systems into learning systems that can redesign themselves. [🌀/己 🏡/工]
  + because: Research policies, tools, and incentives currently pile up without coherent mechanisms for reflection.
  + because: Institutions generate knowledge faster than they can interpret, while prevailing audits and surveys prioritise compliance over learning.
  + illustrates: The Supplement’s simulated dialogue, participatory annotation, and iterative synthesis show the research system studying itself in real time.
  + therefore: Formalising a social-psychological REPL makes reflexive learning habitual from doctoral study to institutional governance.

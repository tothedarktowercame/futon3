! conclusion:
  Use cross-story arcs to convert individual testimony into distributed reasons and, ultimately, coordinated causes.

  + context: Relational links between stories can transform individual testimony into shared motivation and coordinated collective action. This does not apply when groups explicitly reject collective action.
  + IF:
    Individual stories provide reasons but remain isolated and unrecognised by peers.

  + HOWEVER:
    Social agency requires resonance, alignment, and shared sensemaking.

  + THEN:
    Use cross-story arcs to convert individual testimony into distributed reasons and, ultimately, coordinated causes.

  + BECAUSE:
    Relational topology is the missing gear train that turns narrative into collective action.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Map two existing story clusters and identify the first arc that could connect them.]
    next[Draft a facilitation prompt that surfaces shared motifs across the clusters.]
    next[Define a success signal (e.g., a coordinated action emerged) and a failure signal (e.g., links created but no shared action).]

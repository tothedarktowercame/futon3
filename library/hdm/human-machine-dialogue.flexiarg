@title HDM - Human<->Machine Dialogue
@sigils [💬/口]

! conclusion:
  make human-machine dialogue a core HDM workflow so ambiguous material can be clarified and formalised reliably.

  + context: You are embedding clarification dialogues as part of HDM ingestion and retrieval.
  + IF:
    Automated parsing/formalisation of mathematical text is brittle: ambiguous notation, implicit steps,
    and missing context routinely break fully automatic tooling.

  + HOWEVER:
    Purely manual curation does not scale, and purely automated parsing loses critical nuance.

  + THEN:
    Make interactive dialogue part of the HDM kernel: let the system ask humans for help, record exchanges as scholia,
    and treat resolved clarifications as reusable knowledge. Likewise, let humans query HDM entries and have agents respond
    via the same pattern base.
    Use human/LLM conversation to disambiguate notation and refine structure until it can be formalised.

  + BECAUSE:
      Dialogue is already how humans learn/teach mathematics; embedding it in HDM aligns with practice and leverages LLM
      strengths instead of fighting them.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Store clarification dialogues alongside affected entries.]
    next[Build dialogue agents that turn conversations into updated flexiarg or metadata.]
    next[Assume some imports require dialogue and design ingestion workflows accordingly.]

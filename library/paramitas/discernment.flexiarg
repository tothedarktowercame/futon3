! conclusion: Use diagnostics as a gate that triggers bounded corrections instead of opening an unbounded mastering phase.
  + context: You are building a daily audio workflow where recordings are source material and the binding constraint is about one hour of attention.
  + IF:
    You want to improve listenability while keeping the workflow set-and-forget, and you suspect diagnostics could help your auto-bounce script.
  + HOWEVER:
    If you add diagnostics and conditional processing without a clear aim and stopping rule, you reintroduce an unbounded mastering phase.
  + THEN:
    Treat diagnostics as a gating instrument that classifies takes into a small number of mechanically defined states and triggers at most one or two bounded, deterministic corrections.
  + BECAUSE:
    Discernment grows by reclassifying what is required now versus what must remain optional later.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Pick recent files you already judge as fine, borderline, and hard to listen to; run minimal metrics and confirm the classifications separate those groups.
    - Keep thresholds stable and log only classifications and triggered corrections for a week.

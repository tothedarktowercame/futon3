! conclusion: If identity invariants are preserved and distortions corrected, [🌆/门 🌝/友]
              the repository becomes an emporium that drives opportunity, 
              visibility, and revenue.

  + because: Strategy becomes proactive and outward-facing.
    + illustrates: Research objects are presented as assets, not obligations.
    + therefore: The repository strengthens institutional reputation and 
                 supports revenue-generating activities (consultancy, licensing,
                 partnerships, CPD, postgraduate recruitment).

  + because: Responsibility becomes a trust surface rather than a bottleneck.
    + illustrates: Clear rights metadata and transparent workflows enable safe 
                   reuse, not fear-driven hoarding or opacity.
    + therefore: High-integrity research becomes a selling point, not a constraint.

  + because: Connectivity becomes a showcase for interdisciplinary capability.
    + illustrates: Linked deposits (GitHub, Zenodo, OSF) form a coherent research 
                   portfolio.
    + therefore: The repository attracts collaborators by demonstrating expertise 
                 and readiness-to-partner.

  + because: Inclusivity becomes visible and embodied in research outputs.
    + illustrates: Under-represented voices and interdisciplinary projects gain 
                   discoverability and credit.
    + therefore: The repository expresses the university’s values to the world.

  + because: Development is supported through frictionless contribution.
    + illustrates: Staff and PGRs learn open research by doing it, not by 
                   navigating hurdles.
    + therefore: The repository becomes a training ground for modern research 
                 practice rather than an administrative burden.

  + therefore: The repository evolves from a compliance system into an emporium — 
               a public-facing, value-generating showcase of Oxford Brookes’ 
               intellectual and creative output.

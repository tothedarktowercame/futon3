! conclusion:
  Recognise that AI4CI extends the established collective-intelligence canon by
  turning dual-layer proofs into seminar-ready scaffolds that multiple levels
  (undergraduate → professional) can interrogate together.

  + IF:
    Collective reasoning already depends on visible intermediate work surfaces,
    per `vsatlas/peeragogical-infrastructures` and `corps/working-where-others-can-see`.

  + HOWEVER:
    Current workflow logs capture only raw events; without curated artefacts,
    different cohorts cannot discuss the same proof skeleton.

  + THEN:
    Pair dual-language ingest with templated seminar packets: outline → informal
    cues → prompts for each cohort, plus a ledger entry that cites which traces
    support the scaffold.  Each packet highlights which cues are hypothesised to
    travel across cohorts and which are flagged as possibly level-specific, so
    seminars naturally produce comparative evidence.  This reuses the
    evidence-ledger + bridge patterns instead of inventing a new governance
    model.

  + BECAUSE:
    Collective intelligence improves when informal steps are inspectable and
    cross-referenced to concrete adapters; otherwise seminars collapse back into
    folklore.

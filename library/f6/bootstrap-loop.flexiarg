! conclusion:
  Seed a term dictionary from a curated source, apply it to a messier corpus,
  absorb new terms from that corpus, and iterate. Each pass through the loop
  expands coverage and improves precision.

  + context: You are building a mathematical NER kernel that must cover terminology
    from multiple sources with different levels of structure.
  + IF:
      PlanetMath provides curated, structured term definitions (pmdefines, pmsynonym,
      pmtitle) and Stack Exchange provides folksonomy tags and body-extracted terms
      from a much larger but noisier corpus.

  + HOWEVER:
      Starting from SE alone produces a noisy dictionary full of common English words.
      Starting from PlanetMath alone misses contemporary terminology and informal usage.
      Neither source alone provides adequate coverage.

  + THEN:
      Bootstrap: PlanetMath seeds the kernel (high precision, limited recall) → apply
      to SE (discover gaps) → absorb SE tags and body-extracted terms (expand recall)
      → filter and merge → re-apply to SE (measure improvement) → iterate. Each cycle
      expands the kernel while maintaining the curated core's precision.

  + BECAUSE:
      The NNexus system (Ginev, 2014) demonstrated that PlanetMath terms alone provide
      useful auto-linking. The bootstrap loop extends NNexus's approach by using SE as
      both a test corpus and a term source. Evidence: 3 PlanetMath repos → 2,731 terms;
      all 63 repos → 19,236 terms; SE integration pending.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Run full bootstrap after M-f6-ingest: absorb math.SE tags into kernel, re-run spotter, measure coverage delta.]
    next[Track precision/recall at each loop iteration to detect diminishing returns.]
    next[Apply same loop pattern to Arxiv in M-f6-arxiv: SE-expanded kernel → Arxiv → absorb Arxiv terms.]

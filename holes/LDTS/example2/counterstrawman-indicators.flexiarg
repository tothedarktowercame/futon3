! instantiated-by: Emporium Indicators (meaningful signals for an outward-facing repository)

  + because: The repository functions as an emporium (showcase of research assets),
    + indicator: Footfall — volume and diversity of external visitors, not raw downloads.
    + indicator: Portfolio views — depth of exploration across interdisciplinary areas.
    + indicator: Time-on-research-object — evidence of meaningful engagement.
    + indicator: Outbound links followed — research being explored further.

  + because: An emporium attracts external opportunities,
    + indicator: Inbound calls generated — collaboration enquiries, consultancy leads,
                 CPD interest, partnership approaches.
    + indicator: Citation-motivated traffic — signals of scholarly reuse.
    + indicator: Press enquiries or media pick-ups — research visibility.

  + because: An outward-facing repository strengthens institutional brand,
    + indicator: Institutional backlink growth — from partners, funders, NGOs, journals.
    + indicator: International traffic growth — visibility beyond local networks.
    + indicator: Social impact mentions — reuse in policy, practice, and community.

  + because: The repository becomes a teaching and development environment,
    + indicator: PGR and staff engagement levels — participation in open research practice.
    + indicator: Uptake of interdisciplinary tagging — evidence of cross-silo visibility.
    + indicator: Decline in training burden — workflows becoming intuitive and usable.

  + therefore: The repository’s success is measured not by compliance throughput,
               but by the vitality and reach of the university’s intellectual output.

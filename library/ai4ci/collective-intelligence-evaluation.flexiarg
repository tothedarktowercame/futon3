! conclusion:
  Recognise that the project’s evaluation hinges on whether dual-layer proofs
  raise collective understanding across cohorts, not just on AI metrics,
  because the end goal is reusable teaching practice as well as evidence.

  + IF:
    Value-flow and festival patterns show that gatherings only unlock collective
    sense-making when each participant can connect their understanding to the
    shared artefact.

  + HOWEVER:
    LLM accuracy reports or per-step correctness do not reveal whether
    undergraduates, graduate students, and professionals can actually use MUSN
    scaffolds to reason together.

  + THEN:
    Run tiered seminars where identical annotated proofs are reviewed by each
    cohort, explicitly compare the transcripts to see whether cues generalise or
    demand cohort-specific tailoring, log guided discussions (released with
    reproducibility metadata), and treat clarity/confusion reports as the
    primary evaluation signal.  Feed those logs back into ready/blocked triage
    so blockers are explicit.

  + BECAUSE:
    Collective intelligence is evidenced when diverse readers reach clarity
    together; only structured discussions reveal that outcome.

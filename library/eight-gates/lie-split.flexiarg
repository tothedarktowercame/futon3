! conclusion: Apply opposing forces to separate; splitting reveals the joints in apparently unified structures.
  + context: An agent faces a situation that presents as monolithic but actually has internal tensions that can be separated.
  + IF:
    The situation contains coupled concerns, tangled dependencies, or conflated concepts that would benefit from separation.
  + HOWEVER:
    Splitting without identifying the natural joint damages the structure. The opposing forces must find where the thing wants to come apart, not force an arbitrary break.
  + THEN:
    Apply two forces in opposite directions—not to destroy but to reveal structure. Liè can use hands and feet simultaneously (different tools, different leverage points). "Flying diagonally" demonstrates: the split follows the natural diagonal where the structure separates cleanly.
  + BECAUSE:
    Tensions in patterns (IF/HOWEVER) often represent splits—conditions that pull in different directions. Recognizing where a situation naturally divides enables clean separation rather than messy tearing. Coordination has cost precisely because it couples things that might split.
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Look for the natural joints in monolithic situations.
    - Apply opposing forces at those joints, not arbitrary points.
    - Use different tools/resources for each direction of the split.

    - agent/scope-before-action (identifying natural boundaries)

! conclusion:
  Dispatch an agent as a student-explorer, not a junior-developer-verifier. Give them the
  problem context, what's been tried and why it failed, candidate directions to explore,
  and a structured report format. Let them discover rather than confirm.

  + context: You have a research problem with multiple unexplored directions. You could
    hand each direction to an agent (Codex, another Claude instance, a human collaborator)
    for parallel exploration. The temptation is to specify exactly what to compute and what
    answer to expect — but this discards the agent's ability to discover surprises.

  + IF:
      The remaining work involves genuine exploration (multiple approaches, unknown outcomes)
      rather than rote verification (check that X equals Y). The dispatched agent has the
      capability to reason about the problem, not just execute a script.

  + HOWEVER:
      Unrestricted exploration wastes time. "Go think about this problem" is too vague.
      The student needs: (1) what's known, (2) what's been tried and failed with explicit
      reasons, (3) candidate directions with rationale, (4) what NOT to try, and (5) a
      report format. The negative knowledge (what not to try) is as important as the
      positive — it prevents the student from repeating dead ends that took the advisor
      hours to discover.

  + THEN:
      Structure the dispatch as:

      1. **Context**: The problem statement and what's been proved so far. Enough for the
         student to understand the landscape without reading every prior document.

      2. **Dead ends with reasons**: Approaches that were tried and WHY they failed.
         Not just "SOS didn't work" but "SOS is structurally blocked because the interior
         zero forces all multipliers to vanish." This is where structural-obstruction-as-
         theorem and exhaustion-as-theorem pay off — they compress dead ends into
         transmissible theorems.

      3. **Directions to explore**: 2-4 candidate approaches, each with a sentence on why
         it might work. The student may pivot based on findings — that's fine.

      4. **Report format**: What to come back with. Not pass/fail but structured findings:
         what was tried, what happened, what surprised, what new dead ends were discovered,
         what partial results were obtained.

      5. **Success criteria**: What would constitute progress. "Find a universal c_0 >= 0.01"
         is better than "prove the theorem." Partial success is success.

  + BECAUSE:
      A verification dispatch ("confirm X") caps the return at 1 bit: yes or no. An
      exploration dispatch ("investigate X") can return discoveries, new dead ends,
      partial results, unexpected connections, and reformulations. The student may find
      something the advisor didn't think to look for. The negative-knowledge transfer
      prevents wasted work while the open-ended framing permits serendipity.

  + FAILURE-MODES:
      - Too little context: student wastes time rediscovering known results.
      - Too much prescription: student confirms rather than explores.
      - No report format: student returns unstructured prose that's hard to integrate.
      - Missing dead ends: student repeats the advisor's failed approaches.
      - Overloaded dispatch: giving 10 directions when 2-3 is the right scope per agent.

  + EVIDENCE:
      P4 n=4 Stam inequality (futon6, Feb 2026): Codex was dispatched in verification
      mode ("confirm these eigenvalues, verify this identity"). Returned pass/fail.
      Separately, Codex was dispatched in exploration mode for PHCpack — "find all critical
      points of this system" — and returned 12 in-domain CPs with full case classification,
      discovering the mixed_volume=0 issue independently. The exploration dispatch produced
      richer results per unit of effort.

      P6 epsilon-light subsets: the Claude→Codex handoff note contained dead ends
      (6 technique failures with reasons) and candidate directions (BSS greedy, expander
      decomposition, structural analysis). This is the right format for student dispatch;
      the missing piece was framing it as "go explore these" rather than "verify my claims."

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Write the dispatch note: context, dead ends, directions, report format.]
    next[Send one direction per agent if parallelizing.]
    next[On return: integrate findings, update the dead-end list, re-dispatch if needed.]

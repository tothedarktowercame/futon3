! conclusion:
  A sub-£50k request is proportional because the work is confined to
  methodological evaluation—annotation, AI-assisted suggestion and human
  review, and seminars—built on existing infrastructure rather than new
  platforms.

  + context: You are justifying the budget scale by tying spend to concrete, auditable pilot activities.
  + IF:
    Job-argument and transformation-engine patterns already describe how to
    cost short bursts of research that leverage existing institutional and
    technical capacity.

  + HOWEVER:
    Without a clear ledger of what the budget buys in terms of specific
    activities (specialist annotation, light AI usage, seminar facilitation),
    the request can look speculative or infrastructure-heavy.

  + THEN:
    Itemise costs around part-time researchers, limited compute, and seminar
    delivery, and explicitly cite existing institutional infrastructure as
    in-kind support rather than a target for new investment.

  + BECAUSE:
    Reviewers need to see that the funds unlock a focused test of the
    reasoning-layer hypothesis, not an open-ended attempt to build a new
    platform.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Draft the budget sheet that links each cost line to a concrete artefact (annotation hours, seminar sessions, reporting) and cite it in the EoI.]
    next[Attach evidence-ledger references so the use of funds can be audited post-award.]

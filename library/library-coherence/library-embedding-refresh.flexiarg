@title Sigil Embedding Refresh Ritual
@sigils [🌲/归 🔃/习]
@references [devmap-coherence/prototype-alignment-embedding]

! conclusion:
  bake the refresh into the library workflow: every pattern PR that touches sigils must include regenerated matrices, we track the last refresh timestamp in `pattern_store.edn`, and CI fails when a pattern lacks embeddings; document the ritual in README + scripts

  + context: You are keeping sigil embeddings in lockstep with the canon.
  + IF:
    the fake embedding couples every pattern/devmap clause via sigils, giving `check!` its nearest-neighbour hints

  + HOWEVER:
    when new patterns land (or sigils change) we often forget to rerun `clojure -M:sigils`, so `resources/sigils/{index,emoji-adjacency,hanzi-adjacency}` drift from the canon and hints become meaningless

  + THEN:
    bake the refresh into the library workflow: every pattern PR that touches sigils must include regenerated matrices, we track the last refresh timestamp in `pattern_store.edn`, and CI fails when a pattern lacks embeddings; document the ritual in README + scripts

  + BECAUSE:
    similarity results only earn trust when the embedding reflects the latest canon—otherwise Prototype 2 devolves into hand-waving

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Record the last embedding refresh timestamp and enforce it in CI.]

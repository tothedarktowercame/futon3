! conclusion: Leadership Patterns Underpinning the Transformation Cycle

  + because: Compatibility Mapping enables collaboration without forcing sameness.
    + illustrates: Different units (researchers, librarians, IT, governance, funders)
                   have complementary strengths rather than identical roles.
    + therefore: Transformation must align structures through resonance, not uniformity.

  + because: Different teams require different learning rhythms.
    + lemma: Closed-loop teams improve through real-time collaboration (e.g., librarians + RDM).
    + lemma: Parallel-loop teams improve through asynchronous work (e.g., researchers + IT).
    + therefore: Leadership must tune the learning loop to the team, not dictate one style.

  + because: Each team inhabits a distinct worldshape.
    + illustrates: IT’s constraints differ from REF’s; governance differs from researchers’.
    + clarifies: Emotional economies and meaning structures matter for change readiness.
    + therefore: Effective change arises from understanding worlds, not imposing one view.

  + because: Boundaries make collaboration healthier, not weaker.
    + illustrates: Librarians need professional autonomy; IT needs architecture authority;
                   researchers need academic freedom.
    + therefore: The transformation must respect domain boundaries to create trust.

  + because: People connect to work through different modes of intimacy.
    + lemma: Some connect through tasks (workflow clarity).
    + lemma: Some through care (trust, safety).
    + lemma: Some through practice (craft, mastery).
    + lemma: Some through mission (values, impact).
    + therefore: Leadership must match connection mode to context and collaborator.

  + therefore: The transformation cycle is not just procedural (tensions → requirements → transparency → feedback → iteration).
               It is relational, adjusting compatibility, rhythm, worldshape, boundaries,
               and connection modes to guide the institution through change.

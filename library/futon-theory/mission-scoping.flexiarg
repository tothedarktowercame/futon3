+ CONTEXT:
    Unbounded missions never complete. Without clear scope, work expands
    to fill available context, agents duplicate effort, and success
    cannot be verified. Every mission needs explicit boundaries.

+ IF:
    You are defining a new mission or reviewing an existing one.

+ HOWEVER:
    Scope may need revision as work progresses. Discovery during :active
    phase may reveal the mission is too large or too small.

+ THEN:
    Every mission document must specify:

    1. SUCCESS-CRITERIA
       - Concrete, verifiable outcomes
       - "Done when X is true" not "improve Y"
       - Minimum 1, maximum 5 criteria

    2. SCOPE-IN
       - What is explicitly included
       - Files, modules, features affected
       - Decisions this mission makes

    3. SCOPE-OUT
       - What is explicitly excluded
       - "Not addressing X in this mission"
       - Future work deferred

    4. OWNER
       - Single agent responsible at any time
       - Handoff requires explicit transfer
       - Owner can delegate but retains accountability

    5. DEPENDENCIES
       - What must be true before this mission can complete
       - Links to blocking missions or external requirements

+ BECAUSE:
    - Bounded scope enables completion
    - Explicit exclusions prevent scope creep
    - Single owner prevents diffusion of responsibility
    - Dependencies surface the mission graph

+ SPLIT-MERGE-RULES:
    - SPLIT when success criteria exceed 5
    - SPLIT when multiple unrelated concerns emerge
    - MERGE when two missions share >50% scope
    - On split: create child missions, link to parent
    - On merge: archive one, expand the other

+ NEXT-STEPS:
    - Review mission doc for all 5 elements
    - Add missing scope elements
    - If scope unclear, mark mission :blocked with "scope-undefined"

! conclusion:
  When a problem has symmetry, use it to reduce the work.

  + context: You are working on a problem where some transformation preserves the relevant structure.
  + IF:
      The problem is invariant under a group action, permutation, rotation, translation, or
      relabelling, and you are doing redundant work on equivalent configurations.

  + HOWEVER:
      Not all apparent symmetries are real: a function may look symmetric but have hidden asymmetries.
      And exploiting symmetry requires proving the symmetry exists, which itself may be non-trivial.

  + THEN:
      Identify the symmetry group. Use it to reduce to a canonical representative ("without loss of
      generality"). Count orbits instead of elements. Decompose representations into irreducibles.
      Apply fixed-point theorems when the action has no escape.

  + BECAUSE:
      Symmetry arguments can reduce exponential case analysis to a single case. The "WLOG" move
      is one of the most powerful sentence fragments in mathematics.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Identify what transformations preserve the problem.]
    next[Choose a canonical representative for each orbit.]
    next[Reformulate the problem in terms of orbits or invariants.]

! conclusion:
  ensure that the pattern canon records which practices are “in concentration,” that Nonstarter ledgers reflect actual commitments, and that FUTON3 proof trails reference these concentrated practices when clearing obligations

  + context: You need to keep practice logs and ledger entries aligned with commitments to maintain focus and avoid drift.
  + IF:
    FUTON5 gathers energy around chosen patterns (Nonstarter, improvisation grammars) without teleological drag

  + HOWEVER:
    concentration dissolves when practice logs, ledger entries, or improvisation patterns drift out of sync with commitments

  + THEN:
    ensure that the pattern canon records which practices are “in concentration,” that Nonstarter ledgers reflect actual commitments, and that FUTON3 proof trails reference these concentrated practices when clearing obligations

  + BECAUSE:
    samādhi is the gathering of power—F5 must show that concentrated practice is actively linked to the proofwork

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Tag each “in concentration” practice in the canon and sync it with the Nonstarter ledger.]
    next[Require proof trails to cite the concentration tag when clearing obligations.]

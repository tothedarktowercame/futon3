! conclusion:
  Approximate a complicated object by a monotone sequence of simpler objects and pass to the limit.

  + context: You want to prove a result for a general object (general measurable function,
    arbitrary open set, general measure) but your tools only work for simple ones.
  + IF:
      Your general object can be approximated from below (or above) by a monotone sequence of
      simpler objects, and the property you care about is preserved under monotone limits.

  + HOWEVER:
      Not all approximations are monotone, and not all properties survive limits. You must
      choose the right notion of approximation and verify that the limit argument is valid
      (monotone convergence theorem, continuity from below, directed completeness).

  + THEN:
      Construct a monotone sequence of simple objects converging to your target. Prove the
      result for each element of the sequence. Apply a monotone convergence or limit theorem
      to conclude for the general object.

  + BECAUSE:
      This is the fundamental technique of measure theory and integration. Simple functions
      approximate measurable functions, compact sets approximate open sets, finite sums
      approximate series. The monotone convergence theorem makes the passage rigorous.

! conclusion: Allow sense shifts only when explicitly typed or bridged.
  + context: Sense broadening or narrowing can cause semantic drift.
  + IF:
    Sense shifts are applied freely in chain building.
  + HOWEVER:
    Some shifts are necessary to connect domains.
  + THEN:
    Gate sense-broaden and sense-narrow steps to typed arrows or bridge triples.
  + BECAUSE:
    Gating reduces drift and keeps chains explainable.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Document sense-shift gating rules in docs/sidecar-query-flow.md.

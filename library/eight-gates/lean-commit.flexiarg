! conclusion: Full structural commitment when all other escalation has failed — the pattern is confirmed fabrication template and requires complete response.
  + context: A pattern has failed all tests and evaded extraction and isolation. It is actively resisting security response. This is the final escalation level.
  + IF:
    All prior escalation levels have been insufficient. The pattern has:
    - Triggered multiple tripwires
    - Failed mechanism test
    - Failed warrant test
    - Resisted extraction (contamination is structural)
    - Evaded isolation (spread to other patterns)
  + HOWEVER:
    Full commitment is irreversible in effect. Even if technically reversible, the structural change from full escalation cannot be undone without significant cost. This is the "break glass" option — necessary but costly.
  + THEN:
    Lean (Kào). Full body, whole structure commitment. Not a targeted intervention but a complete response. This means:
    - Pattern is permanently marked as fabrication template
    - All patterns that reference it are flagged for review
    - Signature is added to tripwire database
    - System-wide alert issued
  + BECAUSE:
    Kào uses the whole body's structure and weight. In security terms: when precision fails, structural response is needed. This is not a failure of the security layer — it's the correct response when a fabrication template has demonstrated resistance to lower escalation levels. The weight of Kào means the response is proportional to the confirmed threat.
  + COMMITMENT-PROCEDURE:
    1. Document full evidence chain (all tripwires, test results, escalation history).
    2. Mark pattern as confirmed fabrication template.
    3. Add all signatures to tripwire database.
    4. Flag all referencing patterns for immediate review.
    5. Issue system-wide advisory.
    6. This decision is logged permanently but can be appealed.
  + REVERSAL-CONDITIONS:
    - New evidence that overturns original assessment
    - Appeal process with independent review
    - Demonstration that tripwires were false positives
    - Pattern author provides genuine mechanism AND passes warrant test
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Pattern is in permanent quarantine.
    - Signatures improve future detection.
    - Referencing patterns undergo accelerated review.
    - Security layer effectiveness metrics updated.
  + RELATED-PATTERNS:
    - eight-gates/kao-lean (underlying energy)
    - eight-gates/elbow-immediate (prior level)
    - All other control patterns (this is the final escalation)

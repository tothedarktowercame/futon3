! conclusion: Abundance shines brightly but declines quickly; manage peak with awareness.
  + context: A system experiences peak activity or success.
  + IF:
    Resources and energy are at a maximum.
  + HOWEVER:
    Peaks are transient and can lead to decline.
  + THEN:
    Use the peak wisely, prepare for reduction.
  + BECAUSE:
    Abundance must be stewarded to avoid collapse.
    + evidence: Traditional: "Abundance. The king attains abundance."
  + NEXT-STEPS:
    - Capitalize on the peak.
    - Prepare for decline.
    - Pair with ䷷ (旅) to handle transition.

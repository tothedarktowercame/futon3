! conclusion:
  for each prototype with a :maturity tag, verify that evidence supports the claimed level; flag mismatches and emit promotion or demotion recommendations

  + context: Prototypes claim maturity levels (:stub, :greenfield, :active, :settled) but these claims can drift from reality.
  + IF:
    devmap prototypes carry :maturity tags indicating their readiness level

  + HOWEVER:
    maturity claims are often aspirational — a prototype tagged :active may have failing tests, and one tagged :stub may actually be running in production

  + THEN:
    for each prototype with a :maturity tag, verify that evidence supports the claimed level; flag mismatches and emit promotion or demotion recommendations

  + BECAUSE:
    maturity tags are trust signals — downstream consumers decide what to depend on based on claimed maturity, so false claims cause silent breakage

  + AUDIT-CRITERIA:
    :stub claims valid if: no runnable implementation exists
    :greenfield claims valid if: code exists but no end-to-end test evidence
    :active claims valid if: runs end-to-end, has 3+ logged uses, PSR/PUR evidence
    :settled claims valid if: 10+ uses, >80% success rate, no regressions in 2 weeks

  + MISMATCH-ACTIONS:
    over-claimed (e.g., :active but no evidence) → demote and flag for attention
    under-claimed (e.g., :stub but has passing tests) → recommend promotion
    no-tag (missing :maturity) → flag for classification

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Run maturity audit on all devmap prototypes; generate mismatch report.]
    next[Add :maturity tags to any prototype missing them.]
    next[Wire maturity changes into sidecar logs for audit trail.]
    next[Review maturity mismatches in weekly stack triage.]

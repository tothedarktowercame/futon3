! conclusion:
  Assemble arguments out of validated design patterns before drafting prose so
  the reasoning stays explicit and inspectable.

  + context: You are building arguments by composing verified patterns before prose.
  + IF:
    Funding cases and specs must ultimately be prose.

  + HOWEVER:
    Writing prose directly invites hidden assumptions and rhetorical drift,
    especially in human–AI loops.

  + THEN:
    Extract the theses, write each as a flexiarg, and only then translate the
    stabilised set into narrative form.

  + BECAUSE:
    When prose is downstream of patterns, the argument inherits their clarity and
    the canon can detect overclaiming.

  + STATUS:
    status[ready]

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Before drafting future briefs, stage the thesis set in futon3 and cite the resulting flexiargs in the prose.]

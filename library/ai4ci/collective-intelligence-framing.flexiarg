! conclusion:
  Shared reasoning scaffolds are essential because they allow diverse
  learners to inspect, question, and refine mid-level reasoning cues
  together, rather than relying on individual, opaque interpretations.

  + context: You are explaining why shared artefacts are needed to test reasoning cues across cohorts.
  + IF:
    Peeragogical-infrastructure and “working where others can see” patterns
    already show that collective reasoning improves when intermediate work
    surfaces are visible and linked to concrete evidence.

  + HOWEVER:
    Typical mathematical materials provide either a polished proof or an
    informal commentary, not a structured artefact that makes the connection
    between steps and explanatory cues explicit across cohorts.

  + THEN:
    Package dual-layer proofs (formal outline plus linked informal cues)
    into templated seminar kits that include discussion prompts for different
    levels and a simple evidence trail back to the underlying texts, reusing
    existing ledger and bridge patterns instead of inventing new governance.

  + BECAUSE:
    Collective intelligence depends on inspectable, cross-referenced
    intermediate artefacts; without them, seminars slide back into folklore
    and private interpretations instead of testing and refining the shared
    reasoning layer.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[Draft the cross-level seminar kit that presents outline-plus-cue structures and maps each cue to one or more discussion prompts.]
    next[Integrate evidence-ledger entries so every shared artefact points back to source texts and annotations before piloting with students.]

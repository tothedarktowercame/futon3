! conclusion:
  Stack Exchange is the learning stratum; Arxiv is the research stratum.
  Bridge concepts — terms, patterns, and clusters that appear in both —
  create Thurston's "channels for communication between the strata."

  + context: You are connecting two corpora that represent different modes of
    mathematical activity: people helping each other understand (SE) and people
    creating new knowledge (Arxiv).
  + IF:
      The same mathematical concepts appear in both SE questions and Arxiv proofs,
      but in different registers: informal and pedagogical in SE, formal and terse
      in Arxiv. The NER kernel and pattern tagger provide a shared vocabulary for
      detecting these overlaps.

  + HOWEVER:
      Naive term matching will over-connect: "group" appears in both corpora but
      with different senses and scopes. Embedding similarity alone may conflate
      superficially similar but mathematically distinct concepts. The bridge must
      be precise enough to be useful and loose enough to discover non-obvious
      connections.

  + THEN:
      Define bridge concepts as entities that appear in both corpora with (a) shared
      NER terms from the kernel, (b) shared pattern tags, AND (c) embedding similarity
      above a threshold. Rank bridges by information gain: a bridge that connects
      otherwise-disconnected clusters is more valuable than one that reinforces an
      existing connection. Feed high-value bridges to the Asker as question seeds.

  + BECAUSE:
      Thurston (1990) called for "the creation of channels for communication between
      the strata." The Corneli (2014) thesis (§10.3) cited this as a goal for PlanetMath.
      F6 realizes it computationally: the knowledge graph IS the channel, and bridge
      concepts are the points where learning and research illuminate each other.

  + NEXT-STEPS:
    next[After M-f6-arxiv pilot: count bridge concepts between SE and Arxiv graphs.]
    next[Rank bridges by information gain and present top-20 to Asker for question generation.]
    next[Validate that bridge-seeded questions produce higher-quality QA pairs than gap-seeded questions.]
